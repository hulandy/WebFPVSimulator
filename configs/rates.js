/*
 * rates.js: the pilot's rate profile, and the only place it is decided.
 *
 * WHY RATES ARE NOT IN A TUNE FILE.
 *
 * They were, and it made the tunes impossible to compare. The Karate race
 * preset shipped with sugarK's own racing rates, 420 deg/s and 54 expo
 * against the Betaflight default's 670 and none, so switching to it changed
 * the tune AND halved the stick authority in one keypress. The owner flew it
 * and reported the obvious: the default felt better and Karate did not, which
 * is what happens when you change two things and only mean to change one.
 *
 * That preset is no longer shipped at all, and the rule outlived it. It is
 * still why no file in configs/ may carry a rateprofile, and scripts/fc-trace.js
 * F7 and F8 now read every file in that directory rather than the one that
 * misbehaved, so the claim cannot be deleted by deleting a file.
 *
 * A tune is P, I, D, feedforward and filtering. Rates are how far the sticks
 * go. They are separate settings on a real radio, they belong to the pilot
 * rather than to the tune, and they are separate here: no file in configs/
 * carries a rateprofile, and this module owns the rate profile for every
 * tune including a diff the pilot drops on the page.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY THE LISTS WENT.
 *
 * This used to offer five knobs, each a step on a short list: Max rate from
 * a list that stopped at 1400, Centre sensitivity from a list that stopped at
 * 140, ACTUAL rates only, roll and pitch welded together. A pilot who flies
 * 1500 deg/s, or 850, or anything not on the list, could not type it, and a
 * pilot who thinks in Betaflight RC Rate and Super Rate could not enter their
 * own numbers at all. That was reported as the bug it is.
 *
 * So the shape is Betaflight Configurator's shape: a rates TYPE, and three
 * numbers per axis in the units that type displays. The ranges below are
 * Configurator 10.10's own (`changeRatesSystem` in tabs/pid_tuning.js), which
 * are narrower than the firmware's uint8 in the deg/s columns because the
 * setpoint is clamped at rate_limit, 1998 deg/s, and a column that offered
 * 2550 would be offering nothing.
 *
 * UNITS. Everything stored here is the CLI uint8 the firmware holds, not the
 * number the menu shows. Display and storage differ by a per type SCALE:
 * ACTUAL shows rc_rate 7 as 70 deg/s, BETAFLIGHT shows rc_rate 100 as 1.00,
 * and the same uint8 means both. One firmware unit is one step of the menu,
 * which is why a step is not stored: there is nothing between two uint8s.
 *
 * THE CURVES ARE NOT HERE. src/fc/ratescurve.js transcribes all five of
 * Betaflight's rate functions for drawing, and the compiled module flies its
 * own. scripts/fc-trace.js F15 sweeps the two against each other for every
 * type, which is what makes a preview worth drawing.

 * The throttle cap, as a percentage of full throttle.
 *
 * WHY A RACE QUAD NEEDS ONE. This airframe is 8.4 : 1 static thrust to
 * weight, which is what a 710 g 5 inch on 6S with 1900 kV motors really is,
 * and it hovers at 26.2 percent of stick (scripts/flightcheck.js measures
 * both). So three quarters of the throttle travel is above hover, the useful
 * band around it is a couple of percent of stick, and ten percent of stick
 * takes you from holding altitude to climbing at 9 m/s. That is not a bug in
 * the model, it is what the aircraft is, and it is exactly why the throttle
 * limit exists in Betaflight and why racers use it.
 *
 * SCALE, NOT CLIP, and the difference is the whole point. Betaflight offers
 * both in flight/mixer.c applyThrottleLimit:
 *
 *   CLIP    output = min(stick, cap).   Stick above the cap does nothing.
 *           The travel is thrown away and the resolution below is unchanged.
 *   SCALE   output = stick * cap.       Full stick travel is redistributed
 *           across nothing-to-cap, so every millimetre of stick is worth
 *           `cap` as much throttle and the resolution improves by 1/cap.
 *
 * SCALE is the one that gives resolution back. At 60 percent, hover moves
 * from 26.2 to 40 percent of stick and the stick is two thirds as touchy; at
 * 40 percent, hover sits past half stick, which is the classic setup.
 *
 * The cap is NOT reimplemented here. These two lines go into the rate profile
 * and Betaflight's own mixer does the work, per CLAUDE.md: if a Betaflight
 * behaviour is missing, compile more of Betaflight rather than approximate
 * it. It was already compiled; nothing had ever switched it on.

 * value, by six percentage points at a cap of 40, because thrust is not
 * linear in the throttle command: the pack sags and the motors load up, so
 * halving the command does not halve the thrust and the stick does not have
 * to come up as far as the algebra says.
 *
 * These are read off the compiled module by scripts/flightcheck.js, which
 * bisects for the throttle that holds altitude at each cap. Re-run it if the
 * plant changes. It is in the menu because "60 percent" means nothing to a
 * pilot and "hover near a third of the stick" means everything.

/*
 * ONE COLUMN PER AIRCRAFT, because hover does not land in the same place on
 * the stick on both. A 23 g whoop hovers at 32.3 percent of travel uncapped
 * where a 710 g five inch hovers at 26.5, and the gap widens under a cap:
 * the sag and the motor loading that make this a measurement rather than an
 * algebraic hover-over-cap are different on a 1S 280 mAh pack and a 6S one.
 *
 * Re-recorded in full on 2026-09-06 with `node scripts/flightcheck.js` and
 * `node scripts/flightcheck.js --airframe=whoop65`. The five inch column
 * moved by 0.2 to 0.6 of a point from the figures stored before that, which
 * is the plant drifting under it since the table was first taken; nothing
 * reads these but the menu, and a table half of one vintage and half of
 * another is worse than one taken in a single run.
 *
 * The 75 row was taken in the same way when 75 joined the list. Both columns
 * were re-read on the build that added the descent rotor drag, and neither
 * moved: that term is exactly zero at and above a hover, and a hover is the
 * only thing this table measures.
 */
/*
 * READ AT THE WEIGHT THE SHELL FLIES, NOT THE HARNESS'S. The module's own
 * gravity is 1.0 and every check in tests/ runs there; the shell asserts
 * configs/airframes.js gravityBase, 1.62 on the five inch and 2.025 on the
 * whoop, through sim_set_gravity before a pilot ever touches the stick, and
 * a menu that quoted the 1.0 hover to a pilot flying at 1.62 would be eight
 * and a half points low at every cap.
 * So:
 *
 *     node scripts/flightcheck.js --gravity=1.62

 *
 * THE WHOOP HAS ITS OWN TABLE AGAIN, on the same plant. Both entries have
 * a simId of 0, so the whoop flies the five inch plant, and for a while that
 * meant one table for both. Then the whoop's gravityBase moved to 2.025, the
 * five inch's 125, and a plant flown at a different gravity hovers at a
 * different stick: HOVER_WHOOP below is the same five inch plant read at
 * the whoop's own weights, with --gravity and no --airframe. The whoop
 * column before that one, 33.6 at cap 100, had been read off
 * SIM_AIRFRAME_WHOOP65 with --airframe=whoop65, a plant the shell does not
 * select. If a whoop plant is ever selected again it gets its own table

/*
 * AND AT THE PILOT'S WEIGHT AND PACK, because since bug-3a7be142 something
 * flies on this number rather than printing it: the keyboard's throttle
 * keys spring back to hover when they are let go, and a spring to the wrong
 * number is a quad that falls out of the sky every time a key comes up.
 *
 * It did. The keyboard sprang to 0.22, "a hair over measured hover 0.2051",
 * a figure taken at 1.0 g on the plant of 15 August. At the shipped weight
 * hover is 35.0, so letting go of W dropped the stick thirteen points under
 * it and the quad lost a metre in half a second and three in under one.
 *
 * Hover moves with three things a pilot sets, so it is read at all three:
 *
 *   the throttle cap, the rows, which is the table above;
 *   the Weight slider, the columns: 60, 100 and 140 are its ends and its
 *     middle, flown at gravityScaleFor's 0.972, 1.62 and 2.268;
 *   the pack charge a run starts on, the blocks: 4.2, 3.8 and 3.5 per
 *     cell, which are PACK_VOLTAGES and the only charges a run can start at.
 *
 * Nothing else moves it. The pack does not run down in flight: four minutes
 * at hover read 25.05 V under load from the first second to the last, so the
 * charge a run STARTS on is the charge it hovers on throughout.
 *
 * Between two weight columns the answer is interpolated, which is 0.2 of a
 * point at worst uncapped and 0.5 at a cap of 40, measured against all
 * seventeen stops of the slider. Near hover this plant climbs or sinks
 * about 0.9 m/s per point of stick, so half a point is a drift a pilot
 * corrects with a tap, where thirteen was a fall.
 *
 * 100 means full stick is not enough: a 140 weight on a tired pack at a cap
 * of 40 cannot hover at all, and the bisection says so by hitting the stop.
 *
 * Taken 2026-09-24 with the same bisection as scripts/flightcheck.js, on the
 * same config, at each of the nine pairs:
 *
 *     node scripts/flightcheck.js --gravity=0.972 --cell=4.2
 *
 * and so on for 1.62 and 2.268, and 3.8 and 3.5. The weight 100 column at
 * 4.2 reproduced HOVER_5IN_AT_BASE above to the tenth at every cap.
 *
 * The columns are per airframe because the slider's top is: the five inch
 * reads 60, 100 and 140, the whoop 60, 100 and 120, since the module
 * refuses the whoop's 125 and above.

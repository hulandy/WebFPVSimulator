/*
 * ratepresets.js: the pilot's named rate profiles, and the only place they
 * are stored.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Rates are the one setting a pilot changes per track
 * rather than per machine: a tight indoor course wants less stick and a
 * wide open field wants more, and the throttle cap moves with them for the
 * same reason. Before this there was one profile and changing it lost the
 * old one, so "put it back the way it was for the other track" meant
 * remembering eleven numbers. A preset is that profile with a name on it.
 *
 * THE THROTTLE CAP IS IN HERE, and that is a decision. rates.js calls the
 * cap "not part of the rates system" because Betaflight holds it outside the
 * rate profile, and seatAirframe reseeds it when the aircraft changes. Both
 * of those are still true. What is also true, and is what the owner said, is
 * that the cap is the PILOT's choice and it changes per track exactly the
 * way the rates do. So a preset carries it, and loading a preset sets it.
 *
 * THERE IS NO SERVER. Every preset lives in this browser's local storage and
 * nowhere else. No account, no sync, nothing uploaded, and the shell says so
 * in three places rather than assuming a pilot knows what that means: the
 * lede on the Rates screen, the note on the Preset row, and the save dialog
 * at the moment it matters. See RATES_STORAGE_WARNING below, which is the
 * one copy of that sentence.
 *
 * ONE KEY, VERSIONED AND NAMESPACED, the same shape the track library uses
 * in src/trackbuilder/storage.js:
 *
 *   webfpv.rates.library.v1   every saved profile, by id
 *
 * Reads and writes go through readJson and writeJson in src/share/session.js,
 * which already swallow a private window and a full quota and answer false
 * rather than throwing. A refused write is reported to the pilot rather than
 * dropped, because a save that silently did not happen is worse than one
 * that failed loudly.
 *
 * EVERY READ IS NORMALISED. A hand edited storage entry, or one written by
 * an older build, goes through normaliseRates like any other profile, so a
 * corrupt blob cannot put a rate on the craft that the menu cannot draw.

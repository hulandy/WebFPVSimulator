/*
 * main.js: the shell. Loads dist/sim.wasm, feeds it timestamped stick
 * samples, steps it on a fixed 1 kHz accumulator driven by
 * requestAnimationFrame, renders an interpolated view, and drives the
 * product shell in src/ui/ui.js. The frame delta clocks the accumulator
 * and never reaches the integrator; a dropped frame changes nothing about
 * the trajectory.
 *
 * The page opens on a title: the loaded map fills the canvas, the session
 * airframe flies the map's attract line, and the menu sits on top as a
 * HUD. That shot is the same world the player is about to fly, not a
 * second scene. Settings still has its own cheap studio context, created
 * when that screen opens and torn down when flight starts.
 *
 * Ground handling is shell side: the physics module has no ground plane
 * (the verification harness measures free air behaviour), so the shell
 * raises sim_set_ground and the plant applies a rigid-body contact every
 * 1 ms step. Grass is a dead thump with a short belly slide. Turtle is
 * a scripted recovery: inverted, seated and still shows TURTLE MODE, and
 * any pitch or roll poke flips the hull upright. Hits bounce. The one
 * exception is a clip-through or a leftover overlap bounce cannot leave:
 * the shell freezes, says Crashed, and puts the quad back on the line.
 * See PROGRESS.md.
 *
 * Keys in flight: Escape pauses, R returns to the start line, L is launch
 * control when that setting is on, F3 toggles the performance readout, F8
 * reports a bug. Everything else is a menu choice.
 * Sticks: radio in joystick mode (Gamepad API) or WASD plus arrows.
 * Drop a Betaflight diff file onto the page to fly your own config.

   * PUT THE CRAFT BACK WHERE IT WAS AFTER A CONFIG SWAP, instead of putting

   *
   * WHY THIS EXISTS. Rates are part of the config text, so changing one has
   * to go through sim_init, and sim_init is a full reset: "dynamic state
   * zeroed as in sim_reset", per src/native/sim_abi.h. Every rate change
   * therefore used to end in reset(), which zeroes the LAP clock and drops
   * the quad on the start line. That is right for a tune, which changes the
   * machine, and wrong for rates, which change the pilot: the owner asked
   * for a rate change mid run to leave the run alone, and a pilot tuning
   * stick feel against a corner cannot do it if every nudge costs the lap.
   *
   * WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT CARRY. Position and attitude go back through
   * sim_set_pose, which is the only writer the ABI exposes. VELOCITY,
   * ANGULAR RATE AND MOTOR RPM CANNOT FOLLOW: sim_init zeroes them, no
   * export writes them, and this container has no Emscripten to add one. So
   * the quad resumes stationary where it was rather than carrying its
   * momentum through. That is the honest limit of this change and it is
   * nearly invisible in the path the request describes, where the pilot is
   * on the pause menu and the craft is holding still anyway.
   *
   * WHAT HAS TO BE PUT BACK BY HAND is what sim_init wiped and the shell
   * still believes: the pack, and crashflip. The airframe and the flight
   * style are MODES and survive init by ABI contract; the ground plane is
   * written every frame by the contact loop; angle mode is re-applied by
   * syncAngleMode at the tail of applySettings, which runs after this.
   *
   * The RC grid is re-pinned and the queue dropped for the same reason
   * resetCraft does it: the module's step index went back to zero, and a
   * stick sample stamped on the old clock would land in the integrator's
   * future.

   * REAL CRASHFLIP, HELD, at any attitude.
   *
   * Betaflight's flip-over-after-crash is compiled in and the ABI has
   * driven it since the plant learned about the ground, but the pilot has
   * never been able to reach it: setCrashflip(true) starts the SCRIPTED
   * turtle instead, and that only latches from a genuine inverted rest
   * (shouldEnterTurtle wants upz past -0.35, under 1 m/s and under
   * TURTLE_RATE). Wedged on its side, or winding itself up against a
   * wall, the craft satisfies none of those, so the one escape the pilot
   * had was closed exactly where it was needed. That is the second half
   * of the owner's "i can't turtle out nor can i right it".
   *
   * So this is the real thing, on a held key: the mixer path from
   * mixer.c, driven by the pitch and roll sticks, spinning the high
   * motors to walk the machine out of wherever it is. It is not a
   * scripted animation and it does not choose an attitude for you; it is
   * the same control a pilot has on a real quad, and like the real one it
   * does nothing useful in the air.
   *
   * The scripted turtle keeps the ground it already holds: while a wait
   * or a flip is running it owns crashflipOn, and this stays out.

   * as well as the feeling of impact." That puts the whole message on the
   * sound and the camera, so both have to carry it, and neither did.
   *
   * The sound was a two-way switch, 'crash' over 18 m/s and 'clip' under
   * it, with everything below 4 m/s silent. As the only channel left that
   * is a poor instrument: a gate brush and a wall at speed picked one of
   * two samples. It is continuous now, from the same number the physics
   * used, so a hard hit sounds hard.
   *
   * The camera did nothing at all. There was no impact kick anywhere in
   * the shell: makeLensShake reads rotor speed and nothing else. A real
   * hit throws the whole airframe, and the FPV camera is bolted to it, so
   * the picture moves. That is `impactKick`, decayed per frame and added
   * to the lens shake where it already lands on the camera.
   *
   * And the blades: a spinning 5 inch that meets a wall does not carry
   * its rotor speed through the contact. sim_prop_strike takes it out, so
   * a wall tap costs a beat of thrust and the pilot feels the sag while
   * the motors spin back up. That is a physics consequence rather than an
   * effect, which is why it is here and not in the renderer.

   * CRASH IS A RESET. The owner, 2026-09-24, after flying tumble flat: "when
   * i crash head first or tail first into somthing i should not pause,
   * defying gravety, i should immediately reset, fix the delay". stuckTick
   * waited 1.5 s of stillness (5 s in turtle), and a tail first crash spent
   * the best part of a second rolling flat before turtle was even offered,
   * so a crash was a pause with the craft hanging on a wall or lying on the
   * street, and only then a reset.
   *
   * So a CRASH is set down nearby on the step it is read, exactly as X and
   * stuckTick do it. A crash is a smack, GRAZE_SPEED_MAX of closing or more,
   * the line the recogniser and the impact cue already draw between a
   * deliberate touch and a hit, landed anywhere but on the belly:
   *   a solid (a wall, a gate, a tree, the train): the frame or the lens in
   *     contact, not a prop alone, at that closing speed, with the contact's
   *     normal not along the body's up, and not the underside of something:
   *     a contact whose normal points more than 30 degrees below level
   *     (CRASH_UNDERSIDE_NZ) is a ceiling or a deck overhead, and gravity
   *     takes the craft off it by itself, so there is no pause to cut short
   *     and a craft held there is held by the pilot's own throttle
   *     (scripts/input-check.js, the whoop pinned under the room's ceiling,
   *     which caught the first version of this rule resetting it);
   *   the ground, a roof included: the ground judgement's own hit speed,
   *     with the craft not belly down after the contact step it judged;
   *   or a STOP, one step that changed the craft's velocity by
   *     GRAZE_SPEED_MAX or more, with the craft not belly down after it, in
   *     a step where no solid reported any contact at all. Nothing but a
   *     contact does that in a millisecond: 4 m/s in 1 ms is about 400 g,
   *     where thrust and gravity together give a few tens of g. With no
   *     solid touched, props included, the contact was the ground (the box
   *     the plant has taken as ground, a roof, is not a solid in the world
   *     report). Props included because PROP_F_MAX is 60 N a blade, which
   *     on the 23 g whoop is over 2 m/s a step, so a prop strike alone can
   *     make a stop. This is the flat back first crash, which the hit speed
   *     cannot see: flat on its back, the plant's projection lifts the hull
   *     out of the grass and the props down grab stops it dead in one step
   *     (ground_settle in src/native/sim.c), and sim_ground_contacts counts
   *     impulse hits and not the projection, so the shell was told there
   *     was no contact at all. Measured: 10.3 m/s to 0.02 in one step with
   *     no contact reported, then turtle on the next frame.
   * Nose and tail first are the owner's words, and the rule is wider on
   * purpose, because a craft flying forward meets a wall pitched fifty
   * degrees nose down: geometrically its top front edge lands first, and a
   * nose only test would miss the very crash that was reported. What stays
   * physics: a belly first hit (a hard landing, a skid, a bounce you fly
   * out of), anything under 4 m/s (a wall tap, a nudge), a prop clip and a
   * knock on a ceiling. Those still tumble flat and turtle as before.

   * EVERY PHYSICS STEP, AT ITS OWN ATTITUDE. The owner, 2026-09-26
   * (POLISH-PLAN.md item 16, answer 5): "ok approved", to judge crashes per
   * physics step. Each rule reads one step: its own world report, its own
   * ground contact, the attitude it left, and the ground's cooldown runs on

   *
   * Asked for from the press that starts or resumes a flight, because a

   * fly=1 link has none and is simply refused, which costs nothing. Only a

   * Escape is the pause key and the browser's own way out of fullscreen. The
   * browser takes the press and leaves fullscreen, and leaving fullscreen
   * mid flight pauses, so the key still does what the pilot pressed it for;
   * Resume is a press, and goes back to fullscreen.
   *
   * NOT THE KEYBOARD LOCK API, which would let the page keep Escape and stay
   * fullscreen. Tried on 2026-09-27: in headless Chromium,
   * navigator.keyboard.lock(['Escape']) in fullscreen never settled, and
   * every key after it was swallowed, W and M included, which is a quad that

   * A WORLD DIRECTION INTO THE PLANT, and the one seam every direction goes

   *
   * The pose path is qSpawn applied to a basis change: poseFromState turns a
   * plant position into a world one with simPosToThree and then
   * `applyQuaternion(qSpawn)`, and worldPosToSim above undoes both in the
   * right order. A DIRECTION needs the same rotation and no offset, and it
   * was not getting it: the contact pass handed `threeDirToSim` a world space
   * normal, and threeDirToSim is the basis PERMUTATION and nothing else. A
   * permutation cannot undo a rotation.
   *
   * On a level floor that costs nothing, because a yaw about world up leaves
   * a vertical normal alone, which is exactly why this survived: the ground
   * model, the roof test and the race field all read straight. On a VERTICAL
   * face it is the whole answer. Measured through this chain, a craft flying
   * at 10 m/s square into a wall, with the plant's own velocity beside the
   * normal the plant was handed:
   *
   *   spawn yaw    0 deg   n . v  -10.0   approaching, the impulse is applied
   *   spawn yaw   90 deg   n . v   -0.0   PERPENDICULAR: a head on hit reads
   *                                       as a graze along the face
   *   spawn yaw  180 deg   n . v  +10.0   REVERSED: contact_impulse sees a
   *                                       craft leaving and declines it
   *
   * The freestyle city spawns at yaw pi (src/maps/city/index.js), so every
   * vertical face in the town was the third row. sim.c returns 0 without an
   * impulse when vn >= 0 and there is no penetration to push out of, so a
   * wall tap in the town got no restitution, no friction and no separation:
   * the sweep parked the hull 8 mm off the face, the pass broke out on a
   * zero impulse and threw away the tangential travel with it, and the craft
   * sat on the wall. That is the owner's report, and it is a frame error
   * rather than a friction one, which is why walking the materials never
   * fixed it.
   *
   * raiseGroundFromState already carried the fix for the ground plane, with
   * a comment describing this exact class of bug. It is here now instead, so
   * there is ONE path, and frame.js stays the only place the basis change
   * lives. scripts/frame-check.js asserts the round trip at four spawn yaws.

   * 0.17 m sideways and 0.19 m upward inside six milliseconds, left the
   * pad at 1 m/s of drift it never asked for, and the impulses that took
   * were the bang at the start line. Muting the cue did not fix it because

   * to screen went 80 to 64 ms at the median and 144 to 80 at the 90th,
   * with no tearing. So the win here is the humble mechanism: this Chrome
   * still presents at vsync, but a loop drawing every 8 or 10 ms hands
   * each refresh a picture milliseconds old instead of up to a whole
   * refresh old. On that result the owner made it a setting ("make it a
   * settings and default it on for low"): Settings, Screen, Frame pacing,
   * whose default follows the graphics preset, the timer exactly on Low
   * (pacingTimerOn in ui.js, where the reasons live with the setting).
   * The ?loop= URL flag still forces either loop for a session, over the
   * setting, so an A against B stays one address away.
   *
   * The delay aims the next frame at the display's period less what the
   * GPU takes (the plan's formula), floored at the 4 ms a nested timeout
   * is clamped to anyway: on the laptop this exists for, roughly a 10 ms
   * cadence. The GPU guard stays on watch exactly as under rAF, so a GPU
   * that cannot keep the cadence holds draws rather than queueing them.
   *
   * What stands down while the timer paces, because its frames say
   * nothing about the display: the display period learner (latency.js
   * would learn the timer's own cadence and report a refresh rate that
   * does not exist) and Auto graphics (its evidence is dt against the
   * display's period). Both are gated at their call sites below on the
   * live flag, so they resume the moment the display paces again. On Low
   * that parks Auto's levers while the timer runs, which is accepted:
   * there is no preset below Low for it to move to, and the Render scale
   * slider stays the pilot's. The predicted view keeps the learner's held
   * period as its horizon, a small over lead under the timer, accepted.
   * And the physics contract holds as it does under rAF: the accumulator
   * takes this loop's capped dt, and no delta reaches the integrator.
   *
   * THE LOOP SWAPS LIVE. timerLoop is set by applyLoopMode, from the URL
   * force or the setting, on boot and on every settings change, the
   * preset moves Auto makes included. Each loop hands over to the other
   * from inside its own next tick, so there is never a moment with two
   * schedulers pending: frame() re-arms rAF only while the display paces,
   * and frameTimer() re-arms the timeout only while the timer does.
   *
   * rAF stops with a hidden page; a timer does not, and Chrome throttles
   * it toward one fire a second, which would step the physics 100 ms at a
   * time while nobody watched. So the visibility listener below stops the
   * timer outright when the page hides and restarts it when it shows, and
   * the first frame back reads the same capped dt an rAF return does. The

   * ask where the shot goes and what it is pointed at.
   *
   * WHY THIS EXISTS. The attract camera is the only camera in the shell with
   * nothing to stop it: the quad has colliders and the free camera has a
   * pilot, but this one is a spline and it will fly through a wall without
   * complaint. It was doing so in three of the four freestyle worlds, and
   * the only evidence was a thumbnail that looked wrong.
   * scripts/attract-check.js walks these samples through window.__hit and
   * says so instead.
   *
   * A PRIVATE CAMERA AND A PRIVATE COPY OF THE SHOT. Driving the live
   * attract camera would move the title behind whoever is looking at it and
   * would leave its bank filter holding a timestamp from a probe. Harness
   * only.

 * There is no boot() call here, and there has not been a working one for a

 * This file used to end with `boot().catch(...)`, called with no argument.
 * boot() destructures its argument, so that threw a TypeError on every
 * single load, and the catch appended a banner reading "The simulator could
 * not start." to #ui. Nobody ever saw it, because boot.js calls
 * main.boot({...}) a moment later and Ui.build() clears #ui before the next
 * paint. A load that failed every time and was hidden by the timing of an
 * unrelated line is worse than one that fails visibly: any change to how the
 * Ui handles its root would have put a false failure banner on the front
 * page.
 *
 * boot.js owns the entry point. It passes the loading screen, the boot
 * timestamp and the map id, and it routes a rejection to loading.fail(),
 * which is the screen that can actually say what went wrong and what to do
 * about it.

/*
 * road.js: a road's centre line, its lane lines and its edges, worked out
 * from the road element's control nodes. Pure: no Three.js, no DOM, and no
 * trigonometry.
 *
 * THE FRAME is the document's plan (schema.md): metres, x east, y north, the
 * origin at the plot's south west corner. A road element's `nodes` are
 * relative to its `position`, so dragging a road moves its position and
 * nothing else; roadNodesOf adds the two. src/maps/built/traffic.js takes
 * what comes out of here to the world, through the one conversion
 * src/maps/built/place.js makes for every element.
 *
 * WHY THE BENDS ARE EASED. The physics module drives a car along the points
 * it is handed (src/native/world.c, section 5): the car's centre follows
 * them, so where the road turns at a point the car's velocity turns by as
 * much within one 1 ms step, and the module refuses any point that turns
 * more than 30 degrees. A corner drawn as one point is a lurch. The P2
 * verification also measured a drift car's yaw rate kicking by up to 4.2
 * rad/s where the curvature steps from nothing at the start of a bend,
 * because the drift's slip is proportional to the lateral acceleration, so a
 * step in curvature is a step in heading. So every bend here is EASED: its
 * curvature rises from zero where it leaves the straight, holds, and falls
 * back to zero where it meets the next one, and it is sampled finely enough
 * (BEND_STEP_MAX) that no point turns by more than a few degrees.
 *
 * HOW A BEND IS MADE. At each node where the road turns, the bend is
 * symmetric about the corner's bisector. Its first half is built by walking
 * from the tangent point on the incoming leg in equal steps, turning at each
 * step by an angle that ramps up linearly over the first RAMP of the half
 * and then holds (a discrete clothoid into a circular arc), and its second
 * half is the first reflected across the bisector. A turn is never an angle:
 * it is a rotation by t = tan(turn / 2), cos = (1 - t^2) / (1 + t^2), sin =
 * 2 t / (1 + t^2), the same rational rotation world.c turns a drift by. The
 * one number the shape needs, how hard the plateau turns, is found by
 * halving until the half bend ends exactly on the bisector's heading, whose
 * cosine and sine come from the two legs by the half angle identities. The
 * size then follows from where the two halves meet: the tangent length T
 * from the corner to where the bend begins, which is capped so two bends
 * never overlap on a leg (LEG_SHARE), and the plateau's radius, which is
 * what a car's corner speed is worked out from.
 *
 * ARITHMETIC ONLY. + - * / and Math.sqrt, which IEEE 754 rounds correctly
 * and so gives the same bits in every engine, and Math.round, floor, ceil,
 * min and max, which are exact. No Math.sin, cos, pow, exp, atan2 or hypot:
 * these points are handed to the physics module, and CLAUDE.md requires the
 * same input to give a bit identical state trace in Node and in every
 * browser.
 *
 * DEGENERATE INPUT never throws and never makes a NaN. Nodes that are not
 * finite are left out (the document's normalize has dropped them already,
 * with a note); a node within NODE_MERGE of the one before it is merged
 * into it; a node where the road turns so sharply that no bend fits its
 * legs at DRIVE_RADIUS_MIN (a fold back on itself included), or whose legs
 * are too short for even the least bend, is dropped, and the road is
 * worked out again without it. Each of those is a problem entry naming the
 * node. A road left with fewer than two nodes (three closed) has no centre
 * line and says so.
 *
 * THE API. Plain objects in, plain objects out, nothing kept but roadOf's
 * memory of recent answers.
 *
 *   roadNodesOf(el)                  the element's nodes in plan, absolute:
 *                                    [{ x, y, node }], `node` its index in
 *                                    el.nodes; nodes that are not finite are
 *                                    left out
 *   centreLine(nodes, closed, opts)  the eased centre line. opts.radius is
 *                                    the bend radius wanted (RADIUS_DEFAULT),
 *                                    opts.floor the tightest allowed
 *                                    (DRIVE_RADIUS_MIN), opts.ramp the share
 *                                    of a half bend spent easing in (RAMP;
 *                                    only scripts/roads-check.js asks for

 *
 * A problem is { level, code, message, elementId, node }, the shape the
 * builder's warnings take (src/trackbuilder/warnings.js), so the builder
 * can list them beside its own. `level` is 'info' for a repair nobody need
 * act on, 'warn' for a node that was not used, 'error' for a road with no

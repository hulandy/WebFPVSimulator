/*
 * traffic.js: a map document's roads and vehicles, as the physics module
 * takes them. Pure: no Three.js, no DOM, and no trigonometry.
 *
 * ONE FUNCTION FOR EVERY CALLER. The simulator, the builder's Play and the
 * checks all call trafficOf(doc), so all three hand the module the same
 * numbers: the same lane lines, point for point, the same offsets, the same
 * bodies and speeds. A car's pose is then worked out inside the module from
 * its step clock (src/native/world.c section 5), so where a car is at a
 * given step is the same wherever the map is flown. uploadTraffic hands the
 * result over through src/game/plantworld.js, so nobody writes that loop
 * twice.
 *
 * WHAT A CAR DRIVES. A road element is eased into a centre line by
 * ./road.js. A car's line is that centre line, reversed when it drives
 * against the node order, and moved to its own left by the road's lane
 * offset: width / 4 on a closed road of two lanes, because Japan drives on
 * the left and the built maps are Japanese. On an open road, or a road of
 * one lane, the offset is 0 and the car drives the centre: the module turns
 * a car round at each end of an open road on the line it came along, so a
 * car kept to its left on the way out would come back on the wrong side
 * (road.js roadOf says the same). Only the lines some car drives are
 * uploaded, each once however many cars share it.
 *
 * THE FRAME. Road points are worked out in the document's plan and taken to
 * the world by docToWorld in ./place.js, the one conversion every element of
 * a built map goes through. The world is Three.js metres, Y up, which is
 * what plantworld.uploadRoad takes. ROAD HEIGHT: the built map's ground is
 * flat at zero (./index.js, "the paving is flat and at zero"), and a road is
 * laid on the ground, so every road point is at y = 0; the roofs that
 * groundUnder finds are not where roads go, and the builder warns about a
 * road that crosses a building.
 *
 * THE BODY. world.c models a car as ONE box, from `clearance` up to
 * `clearance + height` in its own frame. The drawn car (src/props/street.js
 * CAR_KINDS, drawn by the town's own builder) has its wheels under a sill
 * 0.36 to 0.52 m up, and the parked car's solids close the slot under it
 * ("a 0.15 m slot under a car is not a line"). A clearance at the sill
 * would leave that slot open under a moving car, a gap a quad could be
 * flown through between the wheels, which a real car's wheels and axles
 * would never allow. So the clearance is 0: the box stands on the road, as
 * the parked car's `under` solid does, and a car is solid from the road to
 * its roof. The box is the drawn car's own length, width and height (for
 * the box lorry, its box body's width, the widest part), so the solid car
 * is the drawn car. Over a saloon's bonnet and boot the box fills air a
 * roof line leaves, a few tenths of a metre: the module holds one box a car,
 * and a box that stopped at the waist would let a quad through the cabin.
 *
 * SPEEDS. Ordinary traffic takes a yard at 10 to 14 m/s, a top speed each
 * vehicle's document carries (its style's to start with, STYLE_DIMS in
 * src/props/types.js), and corners at 2.5 to 4 m/s/s, a driver's comfort,
 * so a 12 m bend is taken at 5.5 to 7 m/s. THE DRIFT CAR, a vehicle with
 * `drift` on, corners at DRIFT.lateral, 8 m/s/s, and slides: the module
 * turns its body into the bend by a slip whose tangent of half is the drift
 * gain times the lateral acceleration, so at DRIFT.gain 0.05 and 8 m/s/s
 * the nose sits about 44 degrees inside its path at the height of a bend,
 * easing in and out with the bend's own curvature, and nothing on a
 * straight. Its top speed is its document's like any vehicle's; DRIFT.speed,
 * 20 m/s, is what the builder offers when drift is switched on. A 12 m bend
 * at 8 m/s/s is 9.8 m/s, and it pulls away at the module's 2.5 m/s/s, so a
 * five inch at 20 to 40 m/s has to work to hold its tail through the bends
 * and to keep up with nothing on the straights.
 *
 * THE LIMITS ARE THE MODULE'S, checked here rather than met there: 16
 * roads, 64 mover slots (a built map has no train, so all 64 are cars'),
 * 8,192 points a road and 16,384 for all of them, 64 speed tables and
 * 65,536 table entries. Each road is also held to sim_world_road's own
 * tests on the very numbers it will be handed (road.js moduleCheck). What
 * does not fit is left out with a problem the builder can show, so
 * uploadTraffic never meets a refusal for anything a document can say.

/*
 * custom.js: the track you built, as a map.
 *
 * This is the thin end of the integration, and it is deliberately thin. The
 * race field already knows how to build a world around a course; the track
 * builder already knows how to write a document; src/game/trackdoc.js already
 * knows how to turn one into the other. All that is left is to fetch the
 * document and hand it over, which is what this file does and all it does.
 *
 * WHICH TRACK. A published course imported from the public board, if one is
 * sitting in the share seat, otherwise the one open in the builder. Flying
 * a course this browser published writes the share seat from the canvas, so
 * a time can still go back to the same listing. A remix of someone else's
 * course clears that seat, so the canvas is what flies, and the menus offer
 * to publish it under a new name.
 *
 * An optional third argument `{ document }` injects a course without touching
 * either seat. The public board's orbit thumbnail uses that so several cards
 * can show several courses at once.
 *
 * NO TRACK IS NOT AN ERROR. A player who picks this map having never opened
 * the builder gets the world with nothing in it and a note saying so, the
 * same way a freestyle map is a map with no gates rather than a broken race.

/*
 * quality.js: named graphics presets, and the only place they are defined.
 *
 * WHY THREE NAMES AND NOT A WALL OF SLIDERS. This is a flight sim with a
 * radio-navigable menu, not a PC configurator. Forza, GT and every recent
 * console racer treat Low / Medium / High as the player-facing control and
 * hide the knobs behind them. One row, three values, a note that says what
 * the current one is for. Changing it rebuilds the world, because the
 * expensive levers (city foliage, shadow proxies) are bake time, not
 * frame time. Grass blades are not a lever: they are not drawn.
 *
 * WHAT THE ORIGINAL SPEC GOT WRONG, AND WHAT THIS FILE FIXES.
 *
 *   "None should require a GPU."
 *   WebGL always talks to a GPU, or to a software rasteriser pretending to
 *   be one (SwiftShader, llvmpipe). The real requirement is: no preset
 *   needs a DISCRETE GPU, WebGPU, compute shaders, mesh shaders or ray
 *   tracing. failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat stays false, so a machine with
 *   only a software renderer still boots. High is sized for a 2021-era
 *   PC or a strong laptop iGPU (RTX 3060 class, Intel Xe, M1), Medium for
 *   a 2020-era laptop iGPU (UHD 620 / Iris Plus / MX350), Low for a Steam
 *   Deck APU at 800p. All three are WebGL.
 *
 *   "If a GPU is present then it is used."
 *   The session renderer asks for powerPreference high-performance, so a
 *   dual-GPU laptop uses the discrete chip rather than the battery iGPU.
 *   Quality then scales resolution and effects, not which device draws.
 *   Orbit thumbnails and the settings-studio craft keep low-power: they
 *   are secondary contexts and must not steal the Deck's one GPU.
 *
 *   "Default to Medium."
 *   High IS the authored look. The field budget check (map-isolation)
 *   pins High's draw calls, triangles and target bytes. Defaulting to
 *   Medium would silently change the product and fail that check. First
 *   run on a Steam Deck / SteamOS user agent picks Low; everyone else
 *   gets High. The player can always change it. Nothing switches Low /
 *   Medium / High in flight: a hitch in FPV is less honest than a menu
 *   the pilot opened on purpose. Under Auto graphics, the default, the
 *   preset may move between runs, on the title, and the internal
 *   resolution moves in flight as a factor on the Render scale slider
 *   (src/render/autoscale.js), which is the owner's ask of 2026-09-27:
 *   "make the browser auto detect and set it to fly well". A preset the
 *   pilot picked by hand is never touched. The pacer that came before
 *   Auto, pace.js, never reached a map and was deleted on 2026-09-28.
 *
 *   "Low, a bit less grass."
 *   Blades are not drawn at any preset. The first 184000 world draws
 *   are still walked so the valley does not relocate. Density is not a
 *   quality lever.
 *
 * TARGETS, not promises. These are the machines the presets are BUILT
 * for, at 60 fps where the hardware can hold it, 40 fps on a Deck in its
 * 40 Hz mode. Fill rate is the enemy on handhelds; draw calls and
 * triangles are the enemy in the city.

/*
 * A NOTE ON THE NOTES, because they are read by a pilot deciding what to
 * pick and they were promising something the field does not do.
 *
 * They used to say "fewer plants", "thinned planting" and "full planting"
 * without saying where. Only the city has a planting lever, `foliageKeep`;
 * the field reads shadowMap and shadowHalf out of this table and nothing
 * else, and its trees, rocks and cliffs come off a fixed rng walk. Measured
 * at 1600 by 900, the field draws 949,309 triangles on High and 949,296 on
 * Medium, the difference being the bloom quads, with the same 134 meshes on
 * all three presets. So the notes now say "the town", which is true, rather
 * than implying a lever the race field has never had.

 * and High too, so the picture is Low's without giving up anything else
 * those presets pay for. It can only narrow what the preset gave: on Low
 * the switch has nothing to take, and turning it on never adds a pass the
 * preset left out.
 *
 * There are two post chains, and they hold the ink differently:
 *
 *   The town's and a built map's Pipeline: the ink is a pass of its own,
 *   `enabled.ink`, and off is not running it, as Low does, which also saves
 *   a full screen pass. What the preset gave is `inkPreset`, written where
 *   the pipeline is built.
 *
 *   The race field's composer: the outline pass is the field's
 *   antialiasing as well as its ink (src/render/post.js, "Antialiasing,
 *   paid for entirely by fetches the ink already made"), and its order in
 *   the composer decides whether a render target needs a depth buffer, so
 *   the pass is left where it is and the ink's strength goes to zero. The
 *   strength the preset gave is `inkStrength`. Only Medium and High have
 *   the pass at all.
 *
 * Called once a frame from main.js with the switch, so a world swapped in
 * (a new map, a new preset) is given it without a call of its own, and each
 * write is guarded on a change. Render only: nothing here is read by the
 * physics, the scorer or the plant.
 *
 * What it does NOT touch is the inverted hull outline on a few props (a
 * gate post, a trunk, a vending machine: outlineHull in celmat.js and
 * hullOutline in the vendored core/outline.js). Those are geometry, every

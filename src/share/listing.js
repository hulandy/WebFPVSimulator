/*
 * listing.js: how a course in this browser relates to the public board.
 *
 * The share seat is a published listing this run can post a time to. The
 * builder canvas is a different key. This file is the one place that looks
 * at both, plus the edit key, and says what the player can do next: upload
 * a time, update a name they own, or publish a copy under a new name.
 *
 * Layout is everything that makes two courses different races: the field,
 * the elements, the flying order. The title is not layout. The handle is
 * not layout either. The board uses the same split, so renaming an owned
 * course keeps the times, and changing the name this browser flies under
 * updates the author and the times posted under the old handle on courses
 * this browser published.

/*
 * THE SAME TRACK, UNDER WHATEVER ID THE BOARD HOLDS IT AT NOW.
 *
 * A board id is minted by the board and a seat remembers it, so a seat is
 * only as good as the listing it came from. Take a track off the board and
 * put it back, which is what scripts/boardpresets.js --replace does and what
 * an admin removal does, and every browser holding a seat for it is left
 * pointing at an id that no longer exists. The pilot is told their track is
 * on the public board, offered Upload, and gets "That track is not on the
 * board." with nowhere to go and a lap they cannot post. That is what this
 * is for, and it was reported from the seat on a shipped RaceGOW room.
 *
 * THE MATCH IS THE LAYOUT, NOT THE NAME. Two tracks with the same name are
 * not the same track and a time on the wrong one is worse than no time at
 * all, so a candidate only counts when layoutFingerprint agrees exactly.
 * That fingerprint reads the field, the elements and the flying order and
 * ignores the id, the name and the credit, which is precisely what survives
 * a republish. The name is used only to decide what to LOOK at first, and
 * the class narrows it before that: a whoop's lap can only belong to a room.
 *
 * The cap is what keeps this from being a crawl of the whole board. In
 * practice the first candidate is the right one, because it is the one whose
 * name matches; the cap is there for the case where it is not.
 *
 * Returns `{ found, sameName }`. `found` is a seat ready to be written.
 * `sameName` is a listing that wears the name but has a different layout,
 * which is a different message: the board's copy is not what was flown, so
 * the time does not belong on it and the pilot needs to know that rather
 * than be told the track is gone.

 *

 *                 a dialog that could not see the board's tags, not an

 * builder changes only the tags it can show: see usableTags in ./board.js.

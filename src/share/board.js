 *   Update listing POST {board}/api/tracks   same, with the edit key from
 *                  the browser that first published. A name-only update
 *                  keeps the times. A layout change clears them. tags
 *                  left out keeps what the listing wears and tags: []
 *                  takes them off. The answer carries the tags it wears.
 *   Post a time    POST {board}/api/tracks/{id}/times   { name, lapMs, threeMs?, ghost? }
 *                  ghost is the base64 lap recording from
 *                  src/share/ghostdata.js, sent when the lap was recorded
 *                  in this session, so the board can hand it to a chaser.
 *   List times     GET {board}/api/tracks/{id}   times[] carry { id,
 *                  hasGhost } beside name and lapMs; id is the handle a
 *                  ghost is fetched by.
 *   Fetch a ghost  GET {board}/api/tracks/{id}/times/{timeId}/ghost
 *                  { id, name, lapMs, ghost }
 *   File a bug     POST {board}/api/bugs   { kind, title, what, ... }
 *
 * The track document is the only payload. schema.md is the contract. The
 * logo travels inside the document, so a published course wears its sponsor
 * print on every gate and every flag the moment it is flown.
 *
 * The board origin is, in order: a ?board= query, a stored override, then
 * the default for wherever this page is being served from. Nothing here
 * guesses a deployed host: there are exactly two named hosts below and the

 * query wins over everything, and the Publish dialog's stored override wins

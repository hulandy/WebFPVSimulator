/*
 * patreon.js: the support link, one control, three sites.
 *
 * The mark is Patreon's symbol, the vertical bar and the circle, used to
 * say this product has a Patreon page. Their brand notes allow that, and
 * they do not allow a redrawn wordmark or the symbol dropped into a
 * sentence, so the visible word beside it is the name set in this page's
 * own type. The coral is theirs (#FF424D). Everything around the control
 * stays in this product's palette. A black mark, which is how the symbol
 * is often supplied, would disappear on these dark pages.
 *
 * PATREON_URL is the public page. The same string, and the same note, have
 * to be set in the landing page's src/config.js and the board's
 * public/app.js, because those sites cannot import this file. The note is
 * the hover text: the three memberships, in the order Patreon lists them.

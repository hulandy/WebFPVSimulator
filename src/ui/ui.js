/*
 * ui.js: the product shell. Title, how to fly, credits, settings, pause,
 * results, stick calibration, the flight overlay, and the flight-controller screen.
 *
 * Why this exists: the page used to load straight into a falling quad with
 * a monospace debug dump in the corner. That reads as a tech demo. A
 * player arriving cold needs a title to land on, a way to start, a way to
 * learn the sticks, a way to change the few settings that matter, and a
 * result to read at the end of a run.
 *
 * Every screen is navigable from the keyboard alone and from a radio or
 * gamepad alone. On a radio there are no reliable menu buttons, so the
 * sticks drive the menus: pitch moves the cursor, roll right selects, roll
 * left goes back. Any gamepad button also selects. The title and Quad pose
 * the airframe with the sticks, so there pitch moves the cursor and roll is
 * left to the pose; Rates, Tune, the bench and Stick help use the sticks for
 * what they show, and there only the buttons choose and go back. The legend
 * says which (see pollPad and STICKS_BUSY). Rows that hold a value also
 * have a mouse control: up and down arrows for a stepped number, a
 * dropdown for a named list.
 *
 * The DOM is built here rather than in index.html so the markup and the
 * state machine that drives it sit in one file. Styling lives in
 * index.html next to the rest of the page's CSS.
 *
 * Nothing in this file touches the simulation. It reads state that the
 * shell hands it and returns the player's intent as action strings.

 * WEIGHT: the pilot's answer to "floaty", as a percentage of the weight the

 * gravityBase, 1.62 times 9.80665 on the five inch, which is what the shell
 * hands sim_set_gravity before a pilot touches anything.
 *
 * THIS IS THE THIRD SHAPE OF ONE SLIDER, and each step was a pilot's.
 * First it scaled drag, and the pilot said the difference was hardly
 * discernible. Then it scaled gravity from 70 to 180 percent of 1.0, and the
 * same pilot flew it to the stop and said full Sinky feels about right, then
 * asked for normal to sit at ninety percent of that with headroom either way.
 * So 0.9 times 1.80 is the base, the slider is 60 to 140 around it, and the
 * number a pilot reads is a weight rather than a gravity: "Weight 120" is
 * twenty percent heavier than the machine we ship, whatever the base is.
 *
 * Sinky is not planted. Planted is HORIZONTAL, how far the craft carries.
 * Sinky is VERTICAL, how fast it comes down and how little it hangs, and the
 * drag slider moved the vertical axis by single figures while moving the
 * fall time the wrong way. Gravity moves it fivefold; measured at the base:
 *
 *   weight 60    0.97 g   hover 26.0, fall 10 m 1.57 s, balloon 4.03 m
 *   weight 100   1.62 g   hover 35.0, fall 10 m 1.20 s, balloon 1.62 m
 *   weight 140   2.27 g   hover 42.7, fall 10 m 1.01 s, balloon 0.67 m
 *
 * The floaty end is within half a percent of the 1.0 machine every earlier
 * record was set on, which is deliberate: a pilot who liked the old feel can
 * have it back. The sinky end is heavier than anyone has yet asked for.
 *
 * What it costs, said plainly: scaling gravity is a heavier world rather
 * than a heavier quad. At the base the craft carries 1.62 times the thrust
 * at hover, so every tilt shoves it sideways that much harder, 5.5 to 8.8
 * m/s2 at the same 57 degree bank, where a real heavy quad accelerates at
 * g tan theta whatever it weighs. Rotation is untouched within 1.5 percent.
 * The pilot flew that and called it right; if a later report says it turns
 * too hard, the answer is mass, not this band.
 *
 * THE WHOOP HAS ITS OWN BASE NOW, 2.025, which is the five inch's 125. A
 * pilot flying the same track back to back in Vdrone and here had to take
 * the whoop to 120 to 130, and the owner made 125 its normal. So "Weight
 * 100" is still the machine we ship, it is just a heavier machine on the
 * whoop, and the slider's top is per airframe: the module refuses a gravity
 * above 2.5, so the whoop stops at 120, 2.43. WEIGHT_MAX is the widest any
 * airframe offers and configs/airframes.js weightMax is each one's own.
 *
 * THE BOARD HOLDS THIS BAND TOO. A time and a freestyle run carry the weight
 * they were flown at, and the board refuses one off 60 to 140 in steps of 5

 * THE HEADINGS ARE LETTERED (polish item 19). The wordmark and every room's
 * title are drawn in the lettering's own hand (src/ui/lettering.js
 * paintTitle): heavy slanted capitals, a thick ink line and a hard drop,
 * the hand the freestyle callouts and the results page already speak in,
 * so the menus are the game's own voice and not a developer UI with a
 * manga layer over it.
 *
 * THE TEXT STAYS. The heading keeps its words in the DOM, in its own place
 * and at its own size, for a screen reader, for find in page and for a
 * search engine; .is-lettered makes their fill transparent and the
 * lettering is an aria-hidden canvas laid over them. So the layout is the
 * text's, to the pixel, and lint:shell's measurements cannot move. With
 * forced colours on, the canvas goes and the text comes back (index.html).
 *
 * THE MENUS USE THE HAND WHATEVER CLEAN FPV SAYS. Clean FPV is about
 * flight: nothing drawn over the picture while flying. A menu is not
 * flying, and a title is looked at, not read at 100 km/h. Manga and scoring
 * off is the switch that takes the hand off the menus too: under the
 * root's .no-manga a heading is its own text, as it was before any of this
 * (unletterHeading).
 *
 * PAINTED ONCE. A heading is painted when its screen is shown and again
 * only if what it says, its colour, its size or its room has changed

 * WHAT ONE COURSE CARD CAN DO, once the player has chosen it.
 *
 * The screen used to be a strip of cards over a list of actions, and it read
 * as though the list acted on the card the cursor was on. It did not. The
 * list has always acted on the course in the SEAT, the one loaded and flown,
 * and the only thing choosing a card did was load it and fly it. So the one
 * question a player actually has about a course on the board, "let me look at
 * this one in the builder", had no answer that did not involve flying it
 * first, crashing out, and coming back. Reported exactly that way: I select
 * it and it opens, I cannot select it then edit it from this menu.
 *
 * Choosing a card now names it and lists what can be done with it. Fly it is
 * first, so the common path is Enter Enter and still one keystroke longer
 * than it was, which is the price of the card meaning something. The rows
 * underneath the strip are untouched and still belong to the seat, because
 * publishing and uploading a time are things you do to the course you are
 * flying, not to a card you are pointing at.
 *
 * FLY IT IS THE SCREEN'S PRIMARY, and that is what puts it within reach of
 * a mouse. This list is under every card on the board, thirty of them on a
 * five inch, so from a card near the top it was a scroll away, and the
 * scroll the choose used to make stopped with Fly it under the command bar.
 * The owner, 2026-09-27: "at the moment i click on it, then the page
 * scrolls a bit then i have to scroll down to fly the track". A primary row
 * is also the filled button on the command bar (see primaryItem), which
 * sits in the same pixels however far the page is scrolled, so choosing a
 * card puts Fly it on screen without moving anything. A double click on the
 * card is the same press: see flyCard.

 * THE THREE WAYS IN, and they are the whole of the front door.
 *
 * This used to be two questions in a row. Which aircraft, five inch or
 * whoop, and then race or freestyle, and the second one was skipped on the
 * whoop because a 65 mm machine has nowhere to freestyle. So a pilot who
 * came to fly pressed twice, and what the second press asked depended on
 * what the first one answered: choosing the five inch produced a question
 * the whoop had not been asked. The owner reported exactly that, and it is
 * the report this table answers.
 *
 * Between the two questions there are three legal answers and no more. The
 * whoop has no freestyle, so the pairs are five inch racing, whoop racing,
 * and freestyle, which is the five inch. One screen, three cards, one press.
 * The objection the old aircraft gate wrote down was that a third card
 * beside Race and Freestyle would pretend racing on a whoop was not a real
 * answer; it is answered by racing on a whoop being one of the three cards
 * rather than by asking twice.
 *
 * A card carries both halves of the answer, so act() seats the aircraft and
 * sets the mode in one go. The AIRCRAFT is remembered in settings and the
 * MODE deliberately is not, which is unchanged: what the cursor opens on is
 * the seated aircraft's card, and every visit still passes through here.
 *
 * The pictures are frames of the real renderer, shipped as files by
 * scripts/gatecards.js, because the screen a first visit opens on has to
 * paint before anything has been flown and with no network. The plan
 * drawing over each one is craftSvg, and the two machines are drawn to ONE
 * scale in one viewBox, so the whoop is a fifth of the width of the five
 * inch on its card because it is a fifth of the width of it on a bench. A
 * photograph of a room and a photograph of a field cannot say that: they
 * are both a picture that fills a card.

       * note, the wiki teaser and the best-lap chip off a screen that is
       * asking one question, and the rule that hides an empty menu panel.
       * The pilot got a blank box where the aircraft should be, two

   * `mode` is 'race' or 'freestyle', and it is not a cosmetic switch: a
   * freestyle map has no gates, no lap and no record, so a HUD that showed
   * "Gate 1 of 0" and a lap clock counting from a line that does not exist
   * would be reporting three things that are not true. What it shows instead
   * is what a freestyle pilot actually reads.
   *
   *   THE RUN CLOCK, not a lap and no longer an airtime. It was an airtime,
   *   counting up, on the reasoning that freestyle is flown in packs and how
   *   long you have been up decides when to come home. That was right while
   *   nothing was being measured. A freestyle run is two minutes now, with a
   *   score at the end of it that goes on a public board, so the number a
   *   pilot needs is how much of it is LEFT: the last twenty seconds are when
   *   they decide whether to try the big line, and they cannot decide that
   *   without knowing they are the last twenty seconds.
   *
   *   It is in the lap clock's slot, top centre, rather than beside the
   *   score. That is where a pilot already looks for a clock, and it means
   *   there is exactly ONE clock on the screen: an airtime counting up
   *   beside a run counting down is two answers to the same question.
   *   ALTITUDE ABOVE THE GROUND UNDER THE CRAFT. This one is not optional in
   *   a city. Cross one street and the surface under you moves seven metres,
   *   from the road to the overbridge deck; a height measured from the spawn,
   *   which is what this used to show, is a number that means nothing over a
   *   roof. The shell measures it against the surface query the collision
   *   test uses, so the readout and the thing that kills you agree.
   *   Speed, pack and throttle are the same in both, because they are
   *   properties of the machine and not of the game around it, which is
   *   also why the machine decides whether speed shows at all: osdSpeed in
   *   configs/airframes.js, false on the whoop.

/*
 * trickfilm.js: a moving picture of a trick, drawn from the trick's own
 * definition.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO KEEP: A FILM COMPUTES, IT DOES NOT ILLUSTRATE.
 *
 * Every frame here is derived from the PATTERN the recogniser actually
 * matches. Nothing is drawn from memory and nothing is hand animated, so a
 * film cannot show a pilot one thing while the scorer wants another. Change a
 * pattern and its picture changes with it. If a film looks wrong, the pattern
 * is wrong, and that is the point: this is a second pair of eyes on the
 * catalogue as much as it is a teaching aid.
 *
 * WHICH WAY THE CAMERA FACES is decided by the trick, not by taste. A
 * rotation is only legible from the one direction its axis points AT you:
 *
 *   roll  turns about the nose, so it reads from BEHIND
 *   pitch turns about the wing, so it reads from the SIDE
 *   yaw   turns about the up axis, so it reads from ABOVE
 *
 * A lap around a rail is flown in the plane across the rail, which is the
 * side view; a lap around a post is flown in the horizontal plane, which is
 * the view from above. When a trick has both, the lap wins, because the lap
 * is the bigger shape and the rotation inside it still reads.
 *
 * CEL SHADED, like the town it teaches. Flat colour, hard two pixel ink, no
 * blur and no soft glow. The sky is two flat bands rather than a wash,
 * because a gradient is the one thing a cel shaded frame does not have.
 *
 * PERFORMANCE. One canvas, one requestAnimationFrame, and it only runs while
 * the screen showing it is up: stop() cancels the frame and nothing here
 * holds a timer that outlives the screen. Nothing is allocated in the draw
 * loop. Under prefers-reduced-motion the film does not animate at all and
 * draws its key frames side by side instead, so the shape of the trick is
 * still there to be read.

/*
 * ratespanel.js: the stick-to-rate curve, drawn.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT ANY MORE. It used to be a Configurator Rateprofile
 * table: five columns, three axes, a rates-type dropdown, and every cell
 * writing a CLI key straight into a Betaflight dump. That belonged to the
 * flight-controller screen, and the flight-controller screen is gone. A
 * pilot who wants to hand-edit a rateprofile has Betaflight for it.
 *
 * What is left is the part that was always doing the teaching: a picture of
 * what the sticks do. It reads the pilot's rate profile out of Settings
 * (configs/rates.js owns it) and previews Betaflight's own curve for
 * whichever rates type they chose through src/fc/ratescurve.js, which is a
 * transcription of fc/rc.c. It writes nothing. The rows beside it write the
 * settings, the settings become CLI in configs/rates.js, and Betaflight
 * flies it.
 *
 * ONE CURVE PER AXIS THAT DIFFERS. Roll and pitch share a line while they
 * hold the same three numbers, which is the usual case and the case the menu
 * defaults to; split the pitch on the rows and a third curve appears rather
 * than a second colour appearing on top of a line that did not change.
 *
 * The live dots are the real sticks, fed from the frame loop, so moving a
 * stick on this screen moves the dot along the curve it is about to fly.

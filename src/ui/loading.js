/*
 * loading.js: a loading screen that reports work, not time.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A SPINNER. The page fetches a 1.2 MB renderer from a CDN,
 * a WebAssembly module, a map module graph of up to sixty one files, and then
 * builds a world that generates a few hundred Canvas2D textures on the main
 * thread. On a slow link the first of those dominates; on a slow machine the
 * last does. A bar on a timer is wrong in both cases and, worse, it is wrong
 * in a way that hides which one is the problem. So every stage here is named
 * and every stage's progress comes from something that actually happened. The
 * player just sees "loading" and a joke. The bar still tracks real work, so a
 * stall is a bar that stopped rather than a spinner that lied.
 *
 * WHERE THE PROGRESS COMES FROM, per stage:
 *
 *   Renderer   name and elapsed time only. Streaming the three.js module for
 *              byte progress was built and then withdrawn: measured, the
 *              browser made TWO resource requests for three.module.js, so the
 *              prefetch is not reliably free. See the note in src/boot.js.
 *              This stage does not pretend to know how far through it is.
 *   Simulator  bytes, from the same streamed fetch of dist/sim.wasm, which
 *              the shell needs anyway.
 *   Map        module count, from a PerformanceObserver on resource timing.
 *              The browser walks the import graph itself, so counting the
 *              entries under the map's path is a free and honest measure of
 *              how much of the graph has arrived.
 *   World      the map builder's own onProgress, which reports after each
 *              phase of construction.
 *   First frame  binary, and it is the last thing that happens.
 *
 * WEIGHTS ARE MEASURED, NOT GUESSED. A stage's share of the bar is its
 * measured duration over the total. The defaults below were measured in this
 * container; `planStages` scales the world stage by the map's own recorded
 * build time, so the city's world does not sit inside a slot sized for the
 * field's.

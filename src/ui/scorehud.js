/*
 * scorehud.js: the freestyle score, on the screen, the way Tony Hawk does it.
 *
 * THE THING BEING COPIED, precisely, because "like Tony Hawk" is not a
 * specification. THPS puts four separate readouts on screen and each one
 * does a different job:
 *
 *   1. The running total, top left, permanent, and it only ever goes up.
 *   2. The trick name, shouted the instant the trick is recognised, one
 *      line per trick, stacking upward and fading out on its own.
 *   3. The live combo: the points in the chain and the multiplier they will
 *      be worth, sitting under the names, redrawn every frame so the number
 *      climbs while you are still flying.
 *   4. The verdict. The combo line either banks, and the number flies into
 *      the total, or it BAILS in red and the number goes to nothing.
 *
 * Number 4 is the one that matters. A score that only counts up is a
 * counter. A score that can be lost in front of you is a game, and the whole
 * reason the combo is drawn separately from the total is so that the pilot
 * can see exactly how much is at risk before they decide to try one more
 * thing.
 *
 * THE COUNTER (FREESTYLE-MAPS-PLAN.md section 7, Stage C). The names in 2 are
 * no longer only tricks. One combo is fed by five kinds of thing (the
 * contract is in the header of src/game/score.js): a trick, a named gap, a
 * close call (a skim, under, a thread, a low pass), the chase, and the STF
 * mark, and they are lines in the same stack because it is one chain. Bar
 * one: THE CHASE IS CALLED OUT ONCE, by the chase HUD down the right beside
 * its Tail meter (src/ui/chasehud.js), which is where the pilot was looking
 * and which also calls a tail lost. A banked tail, a car thread or a hurdle
 * also arrives here as a scorer event, and drawing it here as well was two
 * callouts for one tail; its points are in the combo line. The mark is a
 * small line here, because the found callout says what was found and not
 * what it paid. A skim is held, like a manual, so it has a meter while it
 * is held (5, below).
 *
 *   5. The skim meter. While a skim is held: SKIM, the seconds held, the
 *      clearance, and a bar that fills as the gap closes. The Tail meter's
 *      construction, on this side, directly over the combo line it keeps
 *      alive; the names step up out of its way while it is up.
 *
 * THE LETTERING (section 3.2 item 3). On a freestyle map the names and the
 * verdict are hand lettered manga text (src/ui/lettering.js): heavy slanted
 * capitals in a thick ink line, a burst balloon behind a big gap and a big
 * banked combo, and a small katakana sound effect beside the big callouts.
 * The total and the combo line are the same hand in CSS rather than on a
 * canvas, because they change on any frame the chain does and a text node
 * is cheaper to rewrite than a canvas is to repaint. Clean FPV, and every
 * race track, gets the plain HUD text this overlay had before: see
 * setManga.
 *
 * WHERE IT SITS. Down the left, because the existing flight OSD has the top
 * centre (lap clock), both bottom corners (pack and speed) and the bottom
 * centre (the stick ghost). The left column between the top and the bottom
 * corner is the only run of screen this can have without covering something
 * a pilot is already reading, and it happens to be where THPS puts it.
 *
 * AND NEVER THE CENTRE THIRD. Section 3.3: nothing drawn in flight covers
 * the middle third of the frame. The verdict used to land in the middle of
 * the screen, "the one moment the pilot should look away from the quad";
 * it lands on the combo line now, the number it is the verdict on, and
 * every lettered callout is fitted to the outer third of the window at the
 * moment it is drawn (sideRoom), so a long gap name at phone width is
 * lettered smaller rather than reaching across the pilot's line of sight.
 *
 * NO ANIMATION LOOP. Everything that moves is a CSS keyframe on a node that
 * removes itself when the animation ends. This file never asks for a frame,
 * never holds a timer that outlives the run, and does no work at all on a
 * frame where nothing changed except the combo bar, because a rAF driven
 * overlay competing with the render loop is how a smooth sim gets a stutter
 * that nobody can find. A callout paints its canvas once, when it arrives.

 * the multiplier the scorer already computes, so this adds no state and no

 * speaking a different language from the place it sits in. Each is the
 * ordinary spoken word a person would actually use, not a translation of

 * DRAWN, NOT TYPESET (polish item 19). They were font glyphs, いいね, すごい,

 * though the sound effects were already brush strokes to avoid exactly
 * that. So they are the same words in katakana, the way a manga letters a
 * shout, drawn with the sound effects' stroke kana (src/ui/lettering.js):
 * イイネ, スゴイ, ヤバイ, and サイコー for 最高, which is the spelling a manga
 * gives it when somebody yells it. That needed five kana added to the set,
 * イ ネ コ ヤ サ, and ゴ is コ voiced. The kanji was not drawn: ten and ten

/*
 * stickmode.js: which stick carries which channel.
 *
 * A stick mode is not a preference about difficulty or a remapping of
 * controls in the usual sense. It is a fact about the pilot's hands, learned
 * on a transmitter and impossible to unlearn quickly, and it is the reason
 * two testers could not fly this at all:
 *
 *   bug-94da186c  "I need Mode 1 to fly on my smartphone."
 *   bug-a8cd61db  "Is it possible to change to mode 1 stickmode?"
 *
 * A RADIO NEEDS NOTHING FROM THIS. The mode lives in the transmitter, which
 * decides what its own gimbals send before the browser sees anything, and
 * the calibration wizard learns whatever comes out. It is the inputs with no
 * hardware behind them, the THUMB STICKS and the KEYBOARD, that were built
 * Mode 2 and had no way to be anything else. The setting also drives the
 * on-screen gimbals, for everybody including a radio pilot, because a
 * drawing of two sticks that disagrees with the sticks in your hands is
 * worse than no drawing.
 *
 * A GAMEPAD IS THE THIRD INPUT WITH NO MODE OF ITS OWN. Until it has been
 * through the wizard, a pad the browser reports as the Standard Gamepad
 * layout flies the standard sticks in this mode: see standardGuessMap in
 * input.js, and bug-aeb29de7, "Mode 2 isn't mode 2", for what it flew
 * before.
 *
 * The four modes are two independent swaps, which is why this is a table of
 * two booleans rather than four cases:
 *
 *   mode   left stick        right stick
 *   1      yaw, pitch        roll, throttle
 *   2      yaw, throttle     roll, pitch        the default, and what this
 *                                               shell has always been
 *   3      roll, pitch       yaw, throttle
 *   4      roll, throttle    yaw, pitch
 *
 * Modes 3 and 4 are here because they cost nothing once the table exists:
 * every consumer reads the channel names out of it rather than branching on
 * a mode number, so a mode is a row and not a code path.

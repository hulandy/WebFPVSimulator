/*
 * link.js: the radio between the sticks and the flight controller.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MISSING. Until now a stick sample landed on the very next RC
 * slot after its own timestamp, on a mathematically exact 4 ms grid, and
 * every frame arrived. No radio has ever behaved like that. The link is
 * not a detail the controller is insulated from either, because two of the
 * things a pilot feels most are computed FROM the packet cadence:
 *
 *   Feedforward is the derivative of the setpoint across rc frames. A
 *   perfectly regular grid gives it a perfectly regular denominator, so it
 *   is smoother here than on any real radio.
 *
 *   RC smoothing auto-tunes its cutoffs from the measured frame interval.
 *   Given a jitter free interval it picks a filter no real link would get.
 *
 * The result reads as a very slightly uncanny sharpness: the quad is
 * connected to the sticks more tightly than hardware allows. This module
 * puts the radio back.
 *
 * WHERE IT LIVES, AND WHY NOT IN THE MODULE. The determinism contract says
 * the same input stream must produce a bit identical state trace. Shaping
 * the stream is therefore the SHELL's job, not the module's: the module
 * keeps taking timestamped samples and keeps being bit identical for a
 * given stream, and a recorded .rec still replays exactly because it
 * captures what was actually handed to sim_input. Putting the link inside
 * the module would have made the trace depend on a link seed and broken
 * that contract for every existing recording.
 *
 * DETERMINISM. The jitter and loss draws come from a seeded xorshift32,
 * the same generator and the same discipline as the plant's propwash
 * channel: reset with the run, advanced once per frame decision, never
 * from Math.random. A given seed and a given stick stream produce the same
 * link behaviour every time, so a session stays reproducible and the
 * verification harness can run with the link switched off entirely.
 *
 * THE NUMBERS. ELRS at 250 Hz is the reference. Air time plus the
 * receiver's serial handover plus the FC's own read is a few milliseconds,
 * and packet to packet it moves by a fraction of that. The defaults below
 * are the middle of what an ELRS 250 Hz link measures, and every one of
 * them is a setting rather than a constant, because the whole point is
 * that a pilot can dial in the link they actually fly.

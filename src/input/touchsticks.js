/*
 * touchsticks.js: two thumbs on glass, flying the quad.
 *
 * A phone had no way to fly at all: the keyboard needs keys and a radio
 * needs a radio. This is the third stick source, virtual gimbals for the
 * thumbs in landscape, and it slots into InputManager UNDER a connected
 * radio and OVER the keyboard: plug a radio into a tablet and the radio
 * wins, exactly as it wins over the keys.
 *
 * RELATIVE FROM TOUCHDOWN, NEVER A JUMP. The thumb lands wherever it
 * lands, and that point is zero: deflection is the drag from there, full
 * deflection TRAVEL_FRACTION of the plate width. The alternative,
 * absolute mapping, spikes the channel to wherever the thumb happened to
 * hit, which on the throttle is a punch the pilot did not fly. Because
 * the mapping is relative, the whole lower corner of the screen is
 * catchment, not just the drawn plate: a thumb that grabs 40 px off the
 * gimbal still flies. Throttle runs on its own scale, one plate height
 * for the full sweep, a radio's ratio, and stays reachable whatever the
 * deflection travel is tuned to.
 *
 * THROTTLE IS STICKY, EVERYTHING ELSE SPRINGS. A radio's throttle stays
 * where the thumb left it and so does this one: lift the thumb and the
 * hover you trimmed is still trimmed. Yaw, roll and pitch run back to
 * centre at SPRING_RATE when released, a spring rather than a snap, so
 * the setpoint does not step and feedforward does not kick.
 *
 * The nub draws at the CHANNEL, not under the thumb. The thumb may be
 * anywhere in the catchment; the nub is the instrument, and an instrument
 * that showed the finger instead of the value would be decoration.
 *
 * TOUCH POINTERS ONLY. A touchscreen laptop keeps its mouse: pointer
 * events that are not touches fall through to nothing (the zones sit over
 * bare world), and the overlay only mounts at all on a device that
 * reports touch points. Menus never see these zones; the overlay is shown
 * in flight and hidden everywhere else by the shell.
 *
 * A TOUCHSCREEN LAPTOP KEEPS ITS KEYBOARD TOO, BY HAND OVER. A stick key
 * takes the sticks from the plates (InputManager.takeKeys) and the shell puts
 * the plates away; a finger on the glass takes them back (takeThumbs) and
 * sets the sticky throttle where the keys left the collective, through
 * setThrottle below. Until bug-d1d3f4fb this file said the keyboard "still
 * works" and it did not: the input manager took this source's branch and
 * never read a key.
 *
 * Channel signs are the keyboard's, which are the radio's: yaw and roll
 * positive rightward, throttle 0 at the bottom of the plate, and stick
 * forward is NEGATIVE pitch, the same sign the up arrow feeds and
 * placeSticks draws.

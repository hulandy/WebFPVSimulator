/*
 * input.js: stick input for the shell.
 *
 * Sources, in priority order:
 *   1. A radio or controller in joystick mode via the Gamepad API. The
 *      first pad in navigator.getGamepads() is the OS order, which on
 *      Windows follows the Game Controllers list and is not something a
 *      pilot can rearrange without unplugging. Settings, Choose joystick
 *      and the boot/hotplug picker learn which device they meant by a
 *      wiggle, then store id plus index. Axis order and polarity still
 *      differ per radio, so a calibration wizard (Settings, Calibrate
 *      sticks) learns the mapping the usual way: centre, full range, then
 *      one named deflection per channel with a return to rest between
 *      each, then a live check before anything is saved. Until calibrated
 *      a common AETR guess is used for flight, and menu navigation falls
 *      back to any axis at all, so the wizard is always reachable. The
 *      guess is not treated as broken on principle: a radio's throttle is
 *      parked off centre because it has no centring spring, and a guess
 *      seen doing that is trusted for the menus too. See mapUsable.
 *   2. Keyboard: WASD plus arrows mimic a Mode 2 radio. A/D are yaw,
 *      arrows are the right stick: up arrow pushes the stick forward
 *      (nose down), left and right arrows roll. Rate limited so it is
 *      flyable. W/S are a collective, not a latched slider: a radio
 *      throttle is analog and stays where the stick is, a key is digital
 *      and cannot. Hold time is the analog: a tap is a nudge, a longer
 *      hold moves the stick further, a long hold opens to full, and
 *      letting go springs back (to centre on the right stick, to hover
 *      on throttle once airborne). A connected radio keeps its own
 *      analog throttle.
 *
 * Channels are the sim_abi.h convention: roll +1 right, pitch +1 nose up
 * (stick pulled back), yaw +1 nose right, throttle 0..1.
 *
 * Every change is queued as a sample stamped with performance.now(); the
 * main loop maps those wall timestamps onto the simulated clock and the
 * module consumes them by timestamp, per STAGE1.md. WebHID raw report
 * input arrives in a later turn; joystick mode radios are gamepads and
 * take this path.

 * IS EVERYTHING BUT `except` WHERE THE WIZARD LAST ACCEPTED IT?

 * The release phase of every channel waits for the OTHER axes to be at

 * two moves. Rest meant the centre step's reading, for every axis, and that
 * was wrong for exactly one of them: a throttle that has already been
 * identified.
 *
 * The throttle's own release accepts two places, its low end or its rest,
 * because "Now put the throttle all the way back down" is what the prompt
 * says and on a radio the bottom is where it stays. A pilot with a self
 * centring throttle (the LiteRadio of bug-851a43b7) who let go at the
 * centre step, so rest is the middle, and then obeyed that prompt and HELD
 * the throttle down, passed the throttle step and could not pass the next
 * one. Roll never released, because the throttle sat a whole unit from rest
 * and counted as another stick being held, and the hint said "One direction
 * at a time" to a pilot moving one stick. The only way on was to let go of
 * the throttle, which nothing told them. Found by the first draft of
 * scripts/input-selftest.js, which was that pilot and never got past roll.
 *
 * So an identified throttle is parked at either of the two places the
 * wizard has talked about: the bottom of its travel as the sweep found it,
 * or its rest. The bottom is read from the sweep rather than from `low`,
 * because noteThrottleSpring moves `low` to rest on a gamepad, and a
 * gamepad's stick can still be pushed to its physical bottom. Every other
 * axis, identified or not, still has to be at the centre step's rest: a
 * spring centred gimbal has one resting place and being anywhere else is a
 * hold, which is the discipline that keeps a diagonal from assigning two
 * channels.
 *
 * AND IT SAYS WHICH AXIS, the first one out of place, or -1 when every one
 * is parked.
 *
 * Because the screen has to say. bug-f06287ff, a BETAFPV JoyStick whose
 * throttle springs back to the middle, held down at the centre step as that
 * step asks, so its rest is the bottom: the yaw release told the pilot to let
 * the left stick come back to the centre, the throttle sprang up with it, and
 * the wizard waited for it to come back down with a hint about diagonals.
 * "calibration menu process seems to stop around the point where i need to
 * let the left stick come back to center." The wait is the rule above and is
 * right; saying nothing about it was the fault.

 * A THROTTLE THAT SPRINGS BACK HAS NO BOTTOM END, AND THE QUAD TOOK OFF ON
 * ITS OWN BECAUSE THIS CODE ASSUMED IT DID.
 *
 * throttleSpec above maps the far end of the sweep to zero throttle, which
 * is exactly right for a radio: a transmitter's throttle gimbal has no
 * centring spring, so it stays wherever it was put and its bottom stop IS
 * zero. A GAMEPAD's left stick is sprung in both axes. Its bottom stop is
 * one end of a stick that returns to the middle, so the middle, where the
 * stick sits when nobody is touching it, was being read as HALF THROTTLE.
 *
 *   bug-93400859, Fredrik Wormke:
 *   "I found no way to calibrate where 0 throttle is at the resting
 *    position for a gamepad joystick... Drone will take off with no input."
 *
 * Reproduced exactly: a gamepad taken through the wizard the way it asks
 * saves {axis: 2, low: -1, high: 1} and reads 0.500 with nothing touching
 * it. There was no way to calibrate around it, because the wizard never
 * asked the question.
 *
 * It does not have to ask. The release step already watches where the axis
 * goes when the pilot lets go, and it already accepts either answer:
 * `parked` is true at the low end OR back at rest. Which of the two
 * happened is the entire discriminator and it was being thrown away.
 *
 *   a radio      told to put the throttle down, then told to put it back
 *                down, settles AT ITS LOW END. rest and low are the same
 *                place, so there is nothing to correct.
 *   a gamepad    let go, settles AT REST, and rest is a whole unit away
 *                from the low end. Zero throttle belongs at rest.
 *
 * Only `low` moves. `high` is still the end the pilot pushed toward, so
 * full stick is still full throttle, and readGamepad clamps below zero, so
 * pushing the sprung stick past centre the other way is simply idle. The
 * cost is the half of that stick's travel below centre, which is the cost
 * of the control being a centring stick, and it is what the reporter asked
 * for in as many words.
 *
 * A RADIO WHOSE PILOT IGNORED THE CENTRE STEP and left the throttle at
 * mid-stick, then returned it to mid-stick rather than to the bottom,
 * reads as sprung here and gets zero at mid-stick. That is a fair reading
 * of what they demonstrated twice, it is what the prompts asked them not
 * to do, and the failure it produces, half the throttle range, is the
 * recoverable one. The failure in the other direction is a quad that flies
 * away from a pilot who is not touching anything.
 */
/*
 * AND THE DETECTOR ABOVE CAN BE FOOLED BY A PILOT DOING AS THEY ARE TOLD.
 *
 * noteThrottleSpring reads ONE INSTANT, the moment the release timer
 * completes, and asks where the axis ended up. That is a fair question for a
 * gamepad, whose pilot simply lets go, and it is the wrong question for a
 * radio whose throttle self centres, because the release step tells them
 * "Now put the throttle all the way back down" and they HOLD IT THERE. The
 * axis is then sitting on its low end, the detector reads a parked throttle,
 * and the spring is missed:
 *
 *   bug-851a43b7, BetaFPV LiteRadio 3:
 *   "the throttle doesn't go down all the way to 0%. I tried calibrating and
 *    the bottom on the sticks marks the center on the calibrating display."
 *
 * Reproduced through the real wizard: the saved map is {low: -1, high: 1},
 * the check step reads 0.500 with the stick where it rests, and flight reads
 * 0.500 with nobody touching anything.
 *
 * No better instant exists. A pilot may hold the throttle anywhere for any
 * reason and the wizard cannot tell holding from resting, so this stops
 * guessing and ASKS. The check step already shows the live throttle; when it
 * reads high enough to be flying the quad, the screen offers to put zero
 * where the stick is now. The pilot knows whether their hand is on it, and
 * nothing else in this file does.
 *
 * The same pilot, still holding the throttle down on the roll step, met a
 * second wall one step later, and that one is fixed rather than asked
 * about: see blockingAxis.

   * advice tells a pilot to put their radio in. A pilot with such a radio
   * plugs it in, the sticks fly the quad correctly, and they never open the

   * "not calibrated yet" on the front page, in red, forever. Reported as a
   * bug, and it is one: the claim was about a FLAG, `map.stored`, which
   * records whether somebody has been through the wizard, not whether the
   * mapping is right.
   *
   * There is a cheap observation that tells the two apart, and it is the
   * throttle. A THROTTLE DOES NOT SPRING BACK. On a Mode 2 transmitter the
   * left gimbal has no vertical centring spring, so a parked radio leaves
   * that axis sitting at one end, and the axis DEFAULT_MAP calls the
   * throttle reads near -1 with nobody touching it. Every other axis on the
   * machine is spring centred and reads about zero. So if the guessed
   * throttle axis is parked off centre, the guess is describing a real
   * throttle and the mapping is behaving like a radio's.
   *
   * If it is NOT, the guess is wrong in the way that matters most: a
   * gamepad, where axis 2 is half of the right stick, would have "throttle"
   * spring centred at half power. That pilot does need the wizard and is
   * told so.
   *
   * Sticky, because a pilot who moves the throttle through centre has not
   * suddenly acquired a different radio, and a warning that blinks is worse
   * than either answer.

   * AND IS THE GUESS'S YAW REALLY THIS RADIO'S YAW?
   *
   * noteThrottleParked asks the best single question there is about the
   * guess, and a parked throttle is a real answer. But it is ONE AXIS OUT
   * OF FOUR, and it is the only one anything was ever asking about. A radio
   * can satisfy it and still be wrong everywhere else: AETR puts yaw on
   * axis 3, and plenty of transmitters in joystick mode put a slider, a
   * knob or a switch there and yaw further out. That pilot flies with roll,
   * pitch and throttle correct and NO YAW AT ALL, and because the throttle
   * parked, the shell has already decided the guess is behaving like a
   * radio and says nothing at all.
   *
   * Three tickets off the board are this, and none of them knew it:
   * "My yaw doesn't work", "Cant yaw", "No yaw, automatic eject". The third
   * is the same fault read from the other end, a spring centred axis being
   * flown as a throttle, which is a quad that takes off on its own.
   *
   * The observation needs no wizard and costs one pass over the axes. Watch
   * how far each axis has ever travelled. If the axis the guess calls yaw
   * has never left centre, while an axis the guess does not name has swept
   * a full stick's worth AND has been seen at enough distinct levels to be
   * a gimbal rather than a switch, then the pilot is flying a map that does
   * not describe their radio, and the thing they cannot do is yaw.
   *
   * ALIVE LATCHES AND ALIVE WINS. The moment yaw moves once the question is
   * settled in the guess's favour for good, and nothing this function could
   * see afterwards is allowed to reopen it, for the reason on
   * noteThrottleParked: a warning that blinks is worse than either answer.
   *
   * The wrong verdict is NOT a latch of the same kind. It holds until yaw
   * moves, and then it clears, once, permanently. The first draft latched
   * both and returned early on either, which meant the one false positive
   * this can produce, a pilot whose yaw is mapped correctly, who has not
   * touched it yet, and who has swept some other proportional control a
   * long way, got a warning that STAYED UP after they went on to yaw and
   * proved it wrong, until they calibrated or re-picked the pad. The row's
   * own words are "has not moved once", and a row that keeps saying that
   * after it has moved is the blinking warning's uglier cousin. So the
   * spans keep being watched while the row is up, and yaw moving takes it
   * down. That is one transition, not a blink, and it is the transition
   * the sentence above says matters most.
   *
   * What is left is that same pilot seeing the row until the first time
   * they yaw. They get a row offering calibration, and calibration is not a
   * wrong thing to offer them.

   * move plenty, because what is on it is the throttle.
   *
   * What gives a throttle away is how it RESTS. It has no spring, so it
   * stays where it was left, most often at the bottom, and it stays there
   * still for as long as nobody touches it. A yaw stick is on a spring and
   * comes back to the middle the moment the thumb lets go. So if the axis
   * the guess calls yaw sits off centre and still for PARK_MS, the guess has
   * a throttle where it expects yaw, and the pilot's throttle is turning the
   * quad instead of lifting it.
   *
   * Sticky, for the reason on noteThrottleParked: a warning that blinks is
   * worse than either answer. The one false positive is a thumb holding
   * full yaw against the stop for four seconds, and what it earns is an
   * offer to calibrate, which is not a wrong thing to offer.
   *
   * ON THE WALL CLOCK. How long a stick has rested is the pilot's time, so

   * seconds (the title's world still building, shaders compiling) was
   * credited 100 ms of however long it was. Measured in lint:input, where

   * 5.4 s in six capped polls, 5.2 s of it a single stall, and the row
   * arrived at 9.4 s of wall with 4.1 s credited; runs recorded in PROGRESS
   * waited past the check's 20 s. A pilot with a radio in the wrong mode on a slow machine

   * pilot who files one has usually spent a minute trying to yaw first, and

   * far each channel has gone, as this pad and this map deliver it, before

   * A channel is called DEAD when its whole range in DEAD.FLY_MS of flight

   * Tested both ways, as every latch here is: a dead channel that then moves
   * like a stick comes down and is never judged again on this pad and map,
   * and a switch thrown on the same axis is not a stick moving.

 * stage.js: the track as a lit object on a black floor, for the animation
 * export and nothing else.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT src/render/scene.js. That file already builds gates out of
 * pipe with a moulded fitting at every corner, and it already has a dark
 * branch for a micro track, so it looks at first like the obvious base. It is
 * not. The micro branch is a room: pine board walls, an OSB ceiling with
 * joists, a mat with a concrete border and a skirting board, built
 * unconditionally with no way to ask for the object without the room, and a
 * three quarter view from above of a track in it is a view of a ceiling.
 * scene.js also exports four functions, none of which is a gate builder, so
 * the pipe geometry cannot be borrowed without traversing a built world by
 * guesswork. The RaceGOW element set is gates, stacks, ladders, towers, dive
 * gates and poles, every one of which is a pipe frame or a single pipe, so
 * building them here from the same maths the builder already uses is smaller
 * than reaching into a world for them.
 *
 * WHY NOT view3d.js EITHER. It draws a gate as four boxes with two square
 * legs, no fittings, no feet and no shadows, because it is an editor preview
 * where the reading is what matters and a joint is noise.
 *
 * WHAT IS SHARED, and it is the part that matters: every number here comes
 * from the builder's own DOM free maths, apertureFrame, apertureCorners,
 * apertureCenter, aperturesOf and gateSupportFeet. The pipe this draws stands
 * exactly where the builder says the gate is, because it is asking the same
 * functions the builder asks.
 *
 * THE FRAME. Everything below is authored in DOCUMENT coordinates, right
 * handed and Z up, under one root group rotated minus a quarter turn about X
 * so Three sees its own Y up world. That conversion happens once, here, the
 * same way view3d.js does it, and nowhere else in this file.

 * The pilot's report is exactly that. "If there are many gates the pathing

 *
 * RaceGOW'S OWN ANIMATIONS ARE THE ANSWER AND THEY WERE MEASURED. The three

 * and 4 seconds for laps of 41.47, 34.63 and 13.38 m. That is 3.46, 4.33

 * second blocks: 89.48 m over 24.0 s, 3.73 m/s.
 *

 * aircraft's swept radii, 0.1735 over 0.0506, because a machine three and a
 * half times the size has to cover three and a half times the ground to
 * read as the same pace to an eye. It comes out at 12.7 m/s, which is
 * inside the 12 to 15 m/s a five inch actually laps a 400 m course at, and
 * that agreement is the check on the reasoning rather than the reasoning
 * itself.
 *

 *
 * The shadow map is the one that depends on the course. On a full sized field

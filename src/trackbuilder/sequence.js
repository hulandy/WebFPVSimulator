/*
 * sequence.js: flying order, and the aperture model that makes a ladder work.
 *
 * ONE OBJECT IS NOT ONE SEQUENCE ENTRY, and everything awkward about this
 * file comes from insisting on that. The thing standing on the field is a
 * structure. The thing in the flying order is ONE OPENING on that structure.
 * A three level ladder placed once can be flown at position 5 on its bottom
 * level heading north and again at position 9 on its top level heading
 * south, and both of those are entries in doc.sequence pointing at the same
 * element id with different apertureIndex and different entry signs.
 *
 * So: adding an element to the field adds ONE sequence entry, on its lowest
 * opening, because that is the common case. A double stack or a triple stack
 * is then rewritten to a spiral up by the app, because each hole is a gate.
 * Deleting an element deletes every entry that points at it. Reordering
 * moves entries, never elements.

/*
 * BENDING THE LINE.
 *
 * The owner's words: "the flight path in 3d mode - i should be able to click
 * on any section of the flight path and drag it out to create smoother
 * radius' etc". The line is not stored anywhere (schema.md, Deriving the
 * racing line), so there is nothing on it to drag; what shapes it is the
 * knots, and the knot that exists for exactly this is a WAYPOINT: it pins
 * the line to a point, it scores nothing, nothing is built for it and the
 * game does not number it. The RaceGOW5 reconstructions are shaped by
 * waypoints already. So a grab on the line drops a waypoint where the line
 * was grabbed, in the flying order between the two stations that segment
 * runs between, and the drag moves it.
 *
 * WHERE IT GOES. Path segment `segment` runs from knot `segment` to the one
 * after it. Stepping back over any knot with no entry of its own (a stack's
 * wrap, a steering knot) finds the station the segment leaves, and the
 * waypoint goes straight after that station's entry. The closing leg of a
 * circuit leaves the last station, so a grab there appends.
 *
 * THE GATES EITHER SIDE KEEP THEIR FACES. A gate nobody turned by hand is
 * faced along the line from the station before it to the station after it,
 * so a waypoint dropped beside it would turn it towards the waypoint, and
 * the gate would swing about under the author's hand while they bent the
 * line, and so would a marker's pass side. The author is shaping the line
 * through the course as it stands, so the two neighbours are pinned first
 * the way a hand turn pins them (setYaw), and Re-derive hands them back.

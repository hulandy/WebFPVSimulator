/*
 * seat.js: nothing that is built stands in the air.
 *
 * A pilot, on 29 September 2026, on FAI Turkiye 2024: "a few of the gates are
 * 20 meters above the ground. flying around/through them where they are in
 * the sky or where their supposed to be on the ground does not clear them."
 * Four flags 20 m up and a gate 15 m up, each a post or a frame of pipe with
 * nothing under it, because the Velocidrone map the course came from has a
 * rooftop there and the field has not. The owner's ask: when somebody builds a
 * track or a map, no gate and no asset is left floating.
 *
 * WHAT FLOATS. An element that is BUILT (it has pipe, a post, a body) and
 * whose base, position.z, is more than SEAT_SLACK over what it stands on.
 * What it stands on is the ground, or on a map the top of another element's
 * solid box under its origin: a roof, a container, a deck, a ledge. Only a
 * box, because that is all the physics stands a craft on (topUnder in
 * src/maps/built/place.js), so an element seated on something a craft would
 * fall through is not seated. An element is where its ORIGIN is, which is the
 * middle of its footprint and, for a gate, the middle between its uprights: a
 * container half off the one under it stands on it while its middle is
 * over it and falls when the middle is not. That is a rule an author can see
 * from above, and a centre test does not call a cantilever floating on a
 * roof edge the way a test of every corner would call a gate half on a ledge.
 *
 * WHAT DOES NOT. Anything with nothing built to hold up:
 *
 *   a waypoint, a named gap    a point and a window in the air, drawn nowhere
 *   a label, a decal           the plan's ink and the ground's paint
 *   a road, a vehicle          on the ground by construction
 *   a horizontal pole          its legs reach down to the ground from the bar,
 *                              so z is the bar's height (hpoleLayout)
 *   an opening with no pipe    isUnbuilt, or all four sides taken away: the
 *                              hole in a lattice, held by its neighbours
 *
 * The first two are `standsFree` in elements.js, the rest are read off their
 * kind and their sides, so a new element type says what it is where it is
 * defined and this file does not grow a list of names.
 *
 * HOW IT IS FIXED: the element is set down, on the highest thing under its
 * origin that is not over its base, or on the ground. Raising an opening
 * off the ground is what Sill height is for, on legs; a base is for a thing
 * that stands on something.
 *
 * WHERE IT RUNS, and why not in normalize(). The document is left as it was
 * written until it is read by something that draws or flies it, because the
 * board holds the layout a time was set on and a republish that changes the
 * layout clears the times (see layoutHash in the board's src/validate.js). So
 * it runs at the doors: the builder's settle(), restore() and loadDocument(),
 * buildCourse in src/game/trackdoc.js for the race field, and buildMap for a
 * map, which places with seatDocument in src/maps/built/place.js. An old
 * published course is put right when it is read, the same as an old dive hoop
 * (plantImportedHeights), and what is stored is not touched.
 *
 * ARITHMETIC ONLY, comparisons and assignments of the document's own numbers,
 * because buildMap runs it on the way to the physics' world and that world
 * has to be the same bits in every engine.

/*
 * figures.js: how a stacked gate is flown.
 *
 * A double or triple stack is one structure and several openings. Each
 * opening is a pass of its own. The AUTHOR chooses the figure, and this
 * file writes the flying order that figure means: which hole, in which
 * order, from which face.
 *
 *   spiral up     bottom to top, wrapping around the stack, each pass from
 *                 the SAME face. You climb; you do not reverse.
 *   spiral down   top to bottom, wrapping around, each pass from the
 *                 opposite face of the one before. That is what makes it
 *                 a different figure from flying a spiral up in reverse.
 *   split-S       through the top, invert, back through the bottom the
 *                 other way. On a triple the middle opening is skipped.
 *   one opening   a single hole, which is how a stack is placed
 *
 * The sequence is the source of truth. A figure is detected by reading the
 * entries, not stored as a second copy of them, so a track file from before
 * this file existed still round trips and a hand edit that leaves the plan
 * still matches the button.

/*
 * Tracks written when spiral up meant alternating faces. Those files still
 * load; this rewrites a run that is the old plan into the current one, same
 * holes, same first-pass sign, every hole now entered from that face.
 *
 * Spiral down was briefly written as the same face too, which made it a
 * spiral up flown backwards. Those runs are rewritten to alternating faces.
 *
 * IT LEAVES A RUN ALONE IF THE AUTHOR HAS TOUCHED ANY OF ITS FACES, and that
 * is not a nicety, it is the whole difference between a migration and data
 * loss.
 *
 * This recognises an old file by its SHAPE, because the old spelling was
 * never given a schema version to key off. The trouble is that the shape it
 * looks for, a stack whose passes alternate faces, is also exactly what an
 * author gets by building a spiral up and then pressing Flip face on one
 * pass. Reported: a triple stack with the middle pass reversed by hand read
 * correctly in the builder, "enter from the front", and flew from the back
 * in the game. src/game/trackdoc.js runs this on EVERY conversion of a
 * document into a course, so the rewrite happened again on every single
 * load and the author could never make it stick.
 *
 * `overridden` separates the two cleanly. An old file's stack was sequenced
 * with addNextLevel and its faces were derived by applyAutoFaces, which
 * leaves the flag false. Every deliberate face in this build carries it:
 * applyFigure sets it on every pass it writes, and flipFace sets it on the
 * pass it turns. So a run with the flag anywhere in it is a statement, not a
 * spelling, and this leaves it exactly as the author wrote it.

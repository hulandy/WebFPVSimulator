/*
 * warnings.js: everything the results panel has to say about a track.
 *
 * WARNINGS ARE ADVISORY. Nothing in this file may stop a save, an export or
 * an edit. A course designer laying out a deliberately brutal split-S knows
 * more about it than a threshold does, and a tool that refuses to save is a
 * tool people stop using. Every warning names the element and, where it can,
 * the distance along the lap where the problem is, so it can be found.
 *
 * The five the task asks for, all present and each with its own code:
 *   no-face        an element with no entry face set
 *   reversal       two consecutive elements whose faces send the line backwards
 *   tight-corner   a radius of curvature under the track's threshold
 *   barrier        a path segment passing through a barrier
 *   out-of-field   the path leaving the field boundary
 *
 * Plus the ones a designer finds out about the hard way otherwise: an
 * element placed and never sequenced, a lap that does not close, two knots
 * on top of each other, two stations in a row one pass can reach, and a
 * line that goes underground.

 * more than 2^18 of them), and a contact query gathers the cells round the
 * craft, which reaches under a quarter of a metre, so up to two by two of
 * them. It keeps the first WORLD_MAX_CAND shapes it meets and drops the
 * rest without a word (world_gather). Measured on a block of six tall

 * scripts/props-check.js (e) holds this copy to the module: a wall behind
 * 1100 shapes of the cell gathered before it is never touched.
 *
 * So each shape's plan bounds are taken the way the module is handed them:
 * float32 in the colliders (src/game/collide.js build), through
 * threePosToSim (sim x is -z, sim y is -x), a capsule padded by its
 * radius. Then every two by two block of cells counts its distinct shapes.
 * The origin depends on every shape in the map, so moving anything can
 * move every boundary, and this is recomputed with the rest of the report
 * on every edit. Returns { max, shapes }: the most any block holds, and

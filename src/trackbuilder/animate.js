/*
 * animate.js: render a track's lap and hand back the bytes of a GIF.
 *
 * This is the only file that knows both halves. stage.js knows how to draw
 * frame i and nothing about files; gif.js knows how to write a file and
 * nothing about tracks. Here they meet, and the meeting is short on purpose.
 *
 * WHY A BROWSER AT ALL. The scene is Three.js and Three.js is WebGL, so the
 * pixels have to come out of a real GL context. There is no node_modules in
 * this project and the bare three specifier resolves only through a page's
 * import map, so there is no headless path that skips the browser. The
 * builder calls this directly; scripts/trackgif.js reaches it through
 * src/trackbuilder/animate.html in Chromium. Same code, same file.
 *
 * WHY TWO PASSES. A palette has to be chosen before the first frame can be
 * written, and choosing it well means looking at more than the first frame,
 * because the ribbon lights different parts of the track as it goes. Holding
 * every frame to do that would be 300 MB at 512 by 512. So the first pass
 * renders a sixteenth of the frames and counts their colours into a histogram
 * without keeping them, and the second pass renders all of them and feeds
 * each straight to the encoder. Peak memory is one frame and the histogram,
 * rather than the animation, and rather than the sample, which was 19 MB at
 * 512 and would be 300 MB and more at 2048.

/*
 * THE LIMITS OF A PICTURE, in pixels along an edge. scripts/trackgif.js reads
 * these two numbers rather than keeping a copy. The builder's size choice
 * (ANIMATION_SIZES in app.js) cannot, because the builder does not load this
 * file until somebody asks for an animation, so it keeps its edges inside
 * them by hand and a size that went over would be refused below with a
 * sentence.
 *
 * 2048 is the top because it is the biggest that is safe to ask of an ordinary
 * card, not the biggest one can draw. A frame is drawn into a four sample
 * target, four colour and four depth values for every pixel, which is about
 * 150 MB at 2048 and four times that at 4096, with two readback buffers and
 * the textures on top. It is also the size WebGL 2 promises every card can
 * hold as a texture and as a render buffer, and the four sample target needs
 * WebGL 2 already, so it is the largest a sentence can stand behind without
 * asking the card first. The card is asked anyway, below, because a promise
 * about size says nothing about how much memory is free.

/*
 * THE CARD ANIMATION, written once because four callers have to agree on
 * it: the builder renders one the moment a room is published, the simulator
 * does the same through src/share/cardgif.js, scripts/boardgif.js renders
 * one for a room published before any of this existed, and
 * scripts/boardpresets.js renders one for each shipped track it places. The
 * board's own card grid is what all of them are for.
 *
 * 384 BY 240 is the card tile's 16 by 10. A square animation in that box
 * either letterboxes or loses the top of the track to a crop, and the tile
 * is 16 by 10 because the cards were that shape long before this existed.
 *
 * SIX CENTISECONDS A FRAME is about sixteen a second, which is as coarse as
 * a moving thumbnail can be without stepping. HOW MANY frames is not a
 * number here any more, and that is the one thing that changed: it was a
 * flat 60, three and a half seconds a lap whatever the lap, so a 41 m course
 * went round three times as fast as a 13 m one and a grid of cards had no
 * common pace to read. exportTrackGif asks the lap instead, at the one speed
 * LAP_SPEED holds, so a long course is a longer clip rather than a faster
 * one. The cap is what keeps that affordable: see LAP_FRAMES_MAX.
 *
 * A card stays small because of the delay and the frame size, which are the
 * two numbers still here. Measured at one pace on the two ends of what this
 * board carries: RaceGOW5 Track 1 is 14.4 m of lap, 64 frames and 148 kB,
 * and RaceGOW5 Track 8 is 43.9 m, 196 frames and 774 kB, against a board
 * that refuses anything over 1.8 MB. The longest clip the cap allows, 600
 * frames, is three times Track 8 and would still come in under it. What
 * costs is how much of the frame moves, so a busy track costs more than a
 * bare one, and dropping the nameplate let the track fill the frame.
 *
 * NO NAMEPLATE. The stage lays the track's name in the floor, because a GIF
 * pasted into a chat travels alone and has to say what it is of. A card does
 * not travel alone: the board prints the name as a heading directly under
 * the tile and puts the field size chip in the tile's bottom right corner,
 * where a long name came out reading "RaceGOW5 Tra". So the card gets the
 * track and the board gets to write the caption.

 * doc is a track document. The returned bytes are a complete .gif.
 *
 * onProgress(done, total) is called after every rendered frame of both
 * passes, so a caller showing a status line gets a number that only goes up.
 *
 * camera, when given, is a fixed viewpoint in document coordinates, an
 * { eye, aim, fovDeg } that stage.js uses instead of framing the track
 * itself. It is how an export is laid over a reference picture.
 *
 * size is the square edge and stays the default, because a file somebody
 * pastes into a group chat should be square. width and height override it
 * for the one caller that has a shape to fit: the public board's card grid
 * is 16 by 10, and a square animation in it either letterboxes or loses the
 * top of the track to a crop. Everything downstream of the two numbers is
 * the same code, so a 16 by 10 export and a square one differ only in how
 * much of the floor is in shot.
 *
 * A BIGGER PICTURE IS THE SAME PICTURE WITH MORE PIXELS IN IT. The builder
 * offers 512, 1024 and 2048 for a file that is going to be looked at closely
 * rather than pasted into a chat, up to MAX_EDGE. What that asks of the stage
 * is in stage.js (detailOf and REFERENCE_EDGE); what it asks of the machine is
 * time, which goes with the pixels, and memory, which is a frame and the
 * encoder's tables rather than anything that grows with the length of the lap.
 *
 * field, when true, sets the track on a race field with its sponsors' logos on
 * the grass in place of the black stage, and leaves the name off it. It is for a five inch track: a whoop
 * track is flown in a room, which this does not draw.
 *
 * signal is an AbortSignal. Aborting it stops the render at the next frame,
 * frees the card, and rejects with an error named AbortError, which a caller
 * that asked for the stop should treat as an answer and not as a failure. It
 * is there because a 2048 picture is minutes of work, and a dialog that
 * cannot be walked away from for minutes is a dialog people close the tab on.

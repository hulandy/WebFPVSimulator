 * rotation through a second element so the handoff comes out of the disk
 * cache rather than off the wire again. Under a blanket no-store that warm
 * is not an optimisation, it is the same track downloaded twice, and a
 * harness that cannot tell those two apart cannot check the feature.
 *
 * The cost is the one the deploy has: re-encode the crate and a browser
 * that already has it will not notice. Bump MUSIC_REV in
 * src/render/tracks.js, which is the same lever production needs.
